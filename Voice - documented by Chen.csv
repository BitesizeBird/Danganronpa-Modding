00000,Junko,Trial 6,I see... So that's your reaction to seeing an extra large high school girl,18,6,0,1,1,,,
00001,Junko,Trial 6,But are they really that big? Don't you think they're pretty small?,18,6,0,2,2,,,
00002,Junko,Trial 6,Hmm? But the final boss in a certain action game is much bigger.,18,6,0,3,3,,,
00003,Junko,Trial 6,You know? That game - Kniferella!,18,6,0,4,4,,,
00004,Junko,Trial 6,"I see, I see... An estimated bust size of 15 meters, huh? My boobs are hopelessly huge...",18,6,0,5,5,,,
00005,Junko,Trial 6,"Hey hey, want me to squish you inbetween them? Big boobs feel good, you know?",18,6,0,6,6,,,
00006,Junko,Trial 6,If this was a pandering fanservice game full of pretty girls there'd be a CG close-up of my cleavage. But...,18,6,0,7,7,,,
00007,Junko,Trial 6,"...too bad, this isn't a fanservice game. Of course, since it's not an action game either...",18,6,0,8,8,,,
00008,Junko,Trial 6,...you won't even get the refreshing sensation of battling an enormous final boss!,18,6,0,9,9,,,
00009,Junko,Trial 6,Gahahahahaha! So fucking hopeless!,18,6,0,10,10,,,
00010,Junko,Trial 6,"*Gasp* I'm shocked you'd call me ""this thing""! Oh, you're so mean!",18,6,0,11,11,,,
00011,Junko,Trial 6,"I get easily bored of my personality. Like, I  already got bored of my personality who gets easily bored.",18,6,0,12,12,,,
00012,Junko,Trial 6,"And that's when Fuyuhiko would say: ""It's too damn soon you got bored!"", right?",18,6,0,13,13,,,
00013,Junko,Trial 6,"I have pleeenty of data on you guys, so it's sooo easy to know what you're all thinking!",18,6,0,14,14,,,
00014,Junko,Trial 6,"I got bored of getting bored. Jeez, even when I'm dead I still get bored. This sucks.",18,6,0,15,15,,,
00015,Junko,Trial 6,"It's true, I did end up dying the last time.",18,6,0,16,16,,,
00016,Junko,Trial 6,"I-I'm sorry, okay? I didn't mean to go so fast. I-I couldn't help it,you know? It was my first time!",18,6,0,17,17,,,
00017,Junko,Trial 6,"Jeez, stupid! You're the one who made me go!",18,6,0,18,18,,,
00018,Junko,Trial 6,Do you guys know about an artificial intelligence called Alter Ego?,18,6,0,19,19,,,
00019,Junko,Trial 6,Exuberance! We are now an AI! We have transcended humanity!,18,6,0,20,20,,,
00020,Junko,Trial 6,"You see, my personality is like this because I'm the type who dies easily, right?",18,6,0,21,21,,,
00021,Junko,Trial 6,That's why I made my own AI program while I was still alive.,18,6,0,22,22,,,
00022,Junko,Trial 6,And then someone uploaded me into this Neo World Program.,18,6,0,23,23,,,
00023,Junko,Trial 6,And that's how Alter Ego Junko hopelessly appeared in front of you guys.,18,6,0,24,24,,,
00024,Junko,Trial 6,"Don't get conscious and think stuff like ""What can we do?"". I mean, we're all Ultimate Despair here.",18,6,0,25,25,,,
00025,Junko,Trial 6,Each and every one of our classmates looked at us like we're a bunch of loogies on the side of the road.,18,6,0,26,26,,,
00026,Junko,Trial 6,"So, let's all be friends!",18,6,0,27,27,,,
00027,Junko,Trial 6,"Mannn, they hate me...",18,6,0,28,28,,,
00028,Junko,Trial 6,And I was thinking of you guys when I tampered with the graduation program. But they still hate me...,18,6,0,29,29,,,
00029,Junko,Trial 6,"Remember what that fake Makoto said earlier? About what happens to you when you graduate, right?",18,6,0,30,30,,,
00030,Junko,Trial 6,I feel like you guys weren't getting a big enough reward for graduating.,18,6,0,31,31,,,
00031,Junko,Trial 6,"Sooo, I decided to modify what happens so it's something exciting and unique! Just like a game!",18,6,0,32,32,,,
00032,Junko,Trial 6,Uploading your game memories into your real bodies is fine but letting your friends stay dead just sucks.,18,6,0,33,33,,,
00033,Junko,Trial 6,That's why I decided to resurrect them!,18,6,0,34,34,,,
00034,Junko,Trial 6,This is the new graduation program I'm offering.,18,6,0,35,35,,,
00035,Junko,Trial 6,"It wash like real hard, y'know?",18,6,0,36,36,,,
00036,Junko,Trial 6,The graduashion program ish the core part of thish game! Sho it wash protected with a lot of encrypted codesh.,18,6,0,37,37,,,
00037,Junko,Trial 6,It took me a long time! I felt sho much deshpair about how ushelesh I am.,18,6,0,38,38,,,
00038,Junko,Trial 6,"Well, one advantage of being an AI is that I got smarter with computers.",18,6,0,39,39,,,
00039,Junko,Trial 6,"Before that, every time a computer froze I used to put it in a microwave and nuke it!",18,6,0,40,40,,,
00040,Junko,Trial 6,"Show of hands, class. How long do you think it too for me to modify it?",18,6,0,41,41,,,
00041,Junko,Trial 6,"Did you forget? You gotta answer questions to progress the story. That's the rule of this game, right?",18,6,0,42,42,,,
00042,Junko,Trial 6,"By the way, I'll give you a clue: You guys were always watching time slip away at a certain place.",18,6,0,43,43,,,
00043,Junko,Trial 6,How brilliant...ly wrong! Haha! You're totally wrong about that tricky timer!,18,6,0,44,44,,,
00044,Junko,Trial 6,How should I put this? I was just... goofing around?,18,6,0,45,45,,,
00045,Junko,Trial 6,I mean... Isn't stuff you don't understand exciting even though you don't get it?,18,6,0,46,46,,,
00046,Junko,Trial 6,"it's kind of like superhero cosplayers. Or someone else's designs of alien life and stuff, right?",18,6,0,47,47,,,
00047,Junko,Trial 6,In the end it was meaningless. Does that fill you with despair? Like getting booted from a game server?,18,6,0,48,48,,,
00048,Junko,Trial 6,You know those murder mysteries where the culprit is really the detective who's investigating the murder?,18,6,0,49,49,,,
00049,Junko,Trial 6,Well I'm sooo over predictable crap like that. Just what did you expect at this stage of the game?,18,6,0,50,50,,,
00050,Junko,Trial 6,"Well, in a way, the countdown implied I was on a mission.",18,6,0,51,51,,,
00051,Junko,Trial 6,"Did you ever make up your own silly rules, like ""Don't step off the white line when you the road""?",18,6,0,52,52,,,
00052,Junko,Trial 6,I was testing myself to see if I could get you guys into the graduation program before the timer reached zero.,18,6,0,53,53,,,
00053,Junko,Trial 6,"Don't be so disappointed! It's totally true, I had a hard time manipulating the program.",18,6,0,54,54,,,
00054,Junko,Trial 6,"While you guys were at the beach making wrinkly dog faces I was working sooo hard on my own, you know?",18,6,0,55,55,,,
00055,Junko,Trial 6,"Like I said, it's e- *yawn* - easy. It's just a game, after all.",18,6,0,56,56,,,
00056,Junko,Trial 6,"Yeahhh, each and everything that happened in this world was just an event within the game.",18,6,0,57,57,,,
00057,Junko,Trial 6,There's no way  anything that occurred in the game could affect the real world.,18,6,0,58,58,,,
00058,Junko,Trial 6,The game where you throw my words back at me is over. So you don't really have to worry about it!,18,6,0,59,59,,,
00059,Junko,Trial 6,That's right. That's why you should finish this game and go back to living a normal life in the real world.,18,6,0,60,60,,,
00060,Junko,Trial 6,Hm?,18,6,0,61,61,,,
00061,Junko,Trial 6,"Maaan, so annoying! You're so petty. It's not like you're a housewife living on a tight budget.",18,6,0,62,62,,,
00062,Junko,Trial 6,All I want is to put on this graduation performance in a more dramatic way.,18,6,0,63,63,,,
00063,Junko,Trial 6,"Well, if you doubt me, you don't have to go back. Is that what you want? Not to go back?",18,6,0,64,64,,,
00064,Junko,Trial 6,Just as expected from the winners of this killing school trip. Your will to live is truly Ultimate.,18,6,0,65,65,,,
00065,Junko,Trial 6,Wonderful! That's just more reason for you to execute your role as devices.,18,6,0,66,66,,,
00066,Junko,Trial 6,"Okay, now let's stop stalling for time with exposition and hurry up and do it!",18,6,0,67,67,,,
00067,Junko,Trial 6,"Now then, why don't you guys just go ahead and answer with the touch panel that's in front of you?",18,6,0,68,68,,,
00068,Junko,Trial 6,I'm gonna do it... I'm seriously gonna do it. If you  don't hurry up I'm seriously really gonna dooo it!,18,6,0,69,69,,,
00069,Junko,Trial 6,"You don't have to say ""Who are you talking to?"". It doesn't concern a chump like you, Hajime.",18,6,0,70,70,,,
00070,Junko,Trial 6,"It's not ""again"". This time it's the real one.",18,6,0,71,71,,,
00071,Junko,Trial 6,Just when the chumps are in a pinch he's suddenly able to enter for reasons unknown.,18,6,0,72,72,,,
00072,Junko,Trial 6,And thus the main character gallantly appears!,18,6,0,73,73,,,
00073,Junko,Trial 6,"Ahahaha-haha, so cruel! Haha-haha, I'm drooling, haha, so-so much! Haha-haha-ki!",18,6,0,74,74,,,
00074,Junko,Trial 6,"Aaahaha, I'm droooling, ha, I can't stop my leaaaking, haha!",18,6,0,75,75,,,
00075,Junko,Trial 6,"Since I used my tricks to hack into the program he must've hacked in with his too, right?",18,6,0,76,76,,,
00076,Junko,Trial 6,"That's also how you capture memories, right? Even though you haven't aged a day, just like these guys.",18,6,0,77,77,,,
00077,Junko,Trial 6,Don't you understand?,18,6,0,78,78,,,
00078,Junko,Trial 6,It doesn't matter how you got here. As long as you're here you'll be treated like one of my students.,18,6,0,79,79,,,
00079,Junko,Trial 6,"Which meaaans, you must respect my authority.",18,6,0,80,80,,,
00080,Junko,Trial 6,"Ugh, you always had such reckless hope. I love you so much that you disgust me!",18,6,0,81,81,,,
00081,Junko,Trial 6,"Who, li'l old me?",18,6,0,82,82,,,
00082,Junko,Trial 6,"That doesn't mean I was lying, you know? I just didn't make some things clear.",18,6,0,83,83,,,
00083,Junko,Trial 6,"And, even if they're overwritten by my Alter Ego it doesn't mean they'll be a completely different person.",18,6,0,84,84,,,
00084,Junko,Trial 6,The data of everyone who died is stored within me. So I'm sure I can convincingly act out their personalities.,18,6,0,85,85,,,
00085,Junko,Trial 6,"In fact, I have a looot of data on Fuyuhiko. So, I know some things that'll make you happy.",18,6,0,86,86,,,
00086,Junko,Trial 6,I can play a version of Peko that's more to your liking than she ever was.,18,6,0,87,87,,,
00087,Junko,Trial 6,"Ahahahahahaha, Operation Junkofy All Mankind begins here!",18,6,0,88,88,,,
00088,Junko,Trial 6,After uploading my Alter Ego into everyone who died I'm gonna take over the Future Foundation's headquarters.,18,6,0,89,89,,,
00089,Junko,Trial 6,"And then, eventually, there's gonna be a whole lot of me's all over the world!",18,6,0,90,90,,,
00090,Junko,Trial 6,"With this, my despair-utopia where you can despair as you please, Junkoland, will be complete!",18,6,0,91,91,,,
00091,Junko,Trial 6,That's Operation Junkofy All Mankind in a nutshell. Oh yeah! Our dreams are expanding-anding-anding...,18,6,0,92,92,,,
00092,Junko,Trial 6,Is that what you want me to do? Is it still too late to do that?,18,6,0,93,93,,,
00093,Junko,Trial 6,"Man, I was sooo annoyed. I had the authority to add rules but not the authority to delete rules.",18,6,0,94,94,,,
00094,Junko,Trial 6,"Oh well, even if I could've deleted rules. I was still busy with my whole ""taking over your bodies"" plan.",18,6,0,95,95,,,
00095,Junko,Trial 6,"Like I said, I personally didn't care about the outcome of the killings.",18,6,0,96,96,,,
00096,Junko,Trial 6,"Heh, chump change.",18,6,0,97,97,,,
00097,Junko,Trial 6,"That's my Makoto. Mmh, you understand me so well.",18,6,0,98,98,,,
00098,Junko,Trial 6,"For me, despair is not a goal or a set of principles, or a lifestyle, or even an instinct.",18,6,0,99,99,,,
00099,Junko,Trial 6,It's what defines me as Junko Enoshima. It's just my characterization.,18,6,0,100,100,,,
00100,Junko,Trial 6,That's why I'm able to pursue despair with such purity.,18,6,0,101,101,,,
00101,Junko,Trial 6,"For example, when I hear about a beautiful memory that even I, who gets bored easily, still remember fondly...",18,6,0,102,102,,,
00102,Junko,Trial 6,Picture thousands of fools who are madly in love with me dying one by one like insects doused with bug spray.,18,6,0,103,103,,,
00103,Junko,Trial 6,"And the best part is: They did it to themselves, you know?",18,6,0,104,104,,,
00104,Junko,Trial 6,"Thousands of humans falling like dominoes ah-oooh. That memory is sooo beautiful, it made my brain melt.",18,6,0,105,105,,,
00105,Junko,Trial 6,"Oh yeah, I totally forgot you were a survivor of the Reserve Course. By the way, I'm so sorry for your loss.",18,6,0,106,106,,,
00106,Junko,Trial 6,"You don't have to be that surprised. You all look like your parents, friends and lovers all died at once.",18,6,0,107,107,,,
00107,Junko,Trial 6,"Unhhh, that was so rude of me. There's no way you guys even have meaningfull relationships like that anymore.",18,6,0,108,108,,,
00108,Junko,Trial 6,"I mean, you're all Ultimate Despair. You guys have already eaten your fill of despair.",18,6,0,109,109,,,
00109,Junko,Trial 6,"If shomeone like me ish born, that meansh the world ish yeaaarning for deshpair!",18,6,0,110,110,,,
00110,Junko,Trial 6,"But if you do that you guys won't be able to return to the real worl, right?",18,6,0,111,111,,,
00111,Junko,Trial 6,It's such a cruel fate for you guys. But it's awfully convenient for the Future Foundation.,18,6,0,112,112,,,
00112,Junko,Trial 6,"They'll be able to keep all the Ultimate Despairs, including me, trapped in this game forever.",18,6,0,113,113,,,
00113,Junko,Trial 6,"Buuut, Ultimate Despair is hated worldwide. And their lives are no doubt targetted by the Future Foundation.",18,6,0,114,114,,,
00114,Junko,Trial 6,"Oh well, if you don't want to acknowledge that I guess it just can't be helped, can't be helped. Hehe, LOL.",18,6,0,115,115,,,
00115,Junko,Trial 6,But it's sooo ironic! You came all the way here just to find out that graduating is the wrong choice!,18,6,0,116,116,,,
00116,Junko,Trial 6,"Even though you came all this way to win this way, even though you kept sacrificing your friends to win.",18,6,0,117,117,,,
00117,Junko,Trial 6,The goal you guys squirmed to reach was wrong all along! Isn't that just so fucking tragic?,18,6,0,118,118,,,
00118,Junko,Trial 6,"No-ho, no. There's no way such a convenient- *gasp*",18,6,0,119,119,,,
00119,Junko,Trial 6,"Huh? There is? Really? Well, that's the first I've heard of it.",18,6,0,120,120,,,
00120,Junko,Trial 6,"Dear me, I have an unfortunate announcement to make, class. You cannot activate the shutdown.",18,6,0,121,121,,,
00121,Junko,Trial 6,"More importantly, do you know why? Do you know why you can't activate the shutdown?",18,6,0,122,122,,,
00122,Junko,Trial 6,"*Cough* Pay attention, class. According to my information, in order to initiate the shutdown...",18,6,0,123,123,,,
00123,Junko,Trial 6,"...out of 15 people, more than half of them must press ""Graduate"" and ""Repeat"" at the same time.",18,6,0,124,124,,,
00124,Junko,Trial 6,Am I correct?,18,6,0,125,125,,,
00125,Junko,Trial 6,"Even if you wanna cheat, I won't let'cha.",18,6,0,126,126,,,
00126,Junko,Trial 6,The shutdown sequence won't activate unless it knows that different people initiate it.,18,6,0,127,127,,,
00127,Junko,Trial 6,So it's toootally impossible.,18,6,0,128,128,,,
00128,Junko,Trial 6,"Then try explaining it to us. What is this ""chance of winning"" of which you speak?",18,6,0,129,129,,,
00129,Junko,Trial 6,Wha-hat? I can't hear you. You gotta speak up since you're sooo puny.,18,6,0,130,130,,,
00130,Junko,Trial 6,How exciting! I haven't seen these faces in ages! It's like opening your high school year book ten years later.,18,6,0,131,131,,,
00131,Junko,Trial 6,"What? What kind of man isn't excited by big women? Once you get some more experience, you'll understand.",18,6,0,132,132,,,
00132,Junko,Trial 6,There's a looot of kinky things you can do with big girls...,18,6,0,133,133,,,
00133,Junko,Trial 6,"The former heroes plunging themselves into the game world, ignoring all danger...",18,6,0,134,134,,,
00134,Junko,Trial 6,"Jeez, s-stupids! Making such a suicidal move... Did you r-really wanna see me that badly?",18,6,0,135,135,,,
00135,Junko,Trial 6,...,18,6,0,136,136,,,
00136,Junko,Trial 6,Waaahahaaa *Crying*,18,6,0,137,137,,,
00137,Junko,Trial 6,"*Sob sob* You guys showed up looking all cool and stuff... *Sob* And now, all the Ultimate Despairs...",18,6,0,138,138,,,
00138,Junko,Trial 6,Waaahahaaa *Sob* They'll be treated like even bigger chumps!,18,6,0,139,139,,,
00139,Junko,Trial 6,That's right! Back to being hopelessly controlled by me. When you used to feel despair upon despair.,18,6,0,140,140,,,
00140,Junko,Trial 6,But I though the Future Foundation wanted to kill every last Ultimate Despair.,18,6,0,141,141,,,
00141,Junko,Trial 6,"When you say ""support"", do you mean ""you won't suffer when I kill you"" or...?",18,6,0,142,142,,,
00142,Junko,Trial 6,"Can you stop saying cheesy stuff like ""brainwashed""? Washing your brain is like... really nasty.",18,6,0,143,143,,,
00143,Junko,Trial 6,It doesn't matter what you want. That's the reality.,18,6,0,144,144,,,
00144,Junko,Trial 6,Every meaningless thing that happened here will vanish from your minds.,18,6,0,145,145,,,
00145,Junko,Trial 6,"Memory's not all that'll go back to normal. If you lost a limb like Nagtio, it'll still be gone when...",18,6,0,146,146,,,
00146,Junko,Trial 6,"It seems my teachings where quite thorough. However, if you ask me...",18,6,0,147,147,,,
00147,Junko,Trial 6,"People who cling to stuff like hope, talent or admiration are truly the weakest.",18,6,0,148,148,,,
00148,Junko,Trial 6,"Guys who desperately wanna reach the top, they don't think about what'll happen when they're pushed off.",18,6,0,149,149,,,
00149,Junko,Trial 6,They're probably too concerned with having a really nice view while they condescend to others.,18,6,0,150,150,,,
00150,Junko,Trial 6,"Showing off guys like that is sooo easy, heh. I happen to know 17,082 ways to do that.",18,6,0,151,151,,,
00151,Junko,Trial 6,"The point is: the moment you cling to talent and hope, despair has already set in.",18,6,0,152,152,,,
00152,Junko,Trial 6,"Then, what if you think about it like this...",18,6,0,153,153,,,
00153,Junko,Trial 6,It turns out that you guys being Ultimate Despair was just part of the game world.,18,6,0,154,154,,,
00154,Junko,Trial 6,"And in truth, those guys from the Future Foundation might be part of the game world too.",18,6,0,155,155,,,
00155,Junko,Trial 6,They're simply side characters of the game world whose role is to offer hopeless hope to you guys.,18,6,0,156,156,,,
00156,Junko,Trial 6,"Well, after saying all that... I don't even know what's real and what's a game anymore.",18,6,0,157,157,,,
00157,Junko,Trial 6,"Before you do that, we gotta do some reviewing.",18,6,0,158,158,,,
00158,Junko,Trial 6,"Ahem... When you guys activate the shutdown, you'll revert back to when you were known as Ultimate Despair.",18,6,0,159,159,,,
00159,Junko,Trial 6,And your dead friends will never be revived.,18,6,0,160,160,,,
00160,Junko,Trial 6,"And the embodiment, aka me, will be erased. Therey preserving hope in the real world.",18,6,0,161,161,,,
00161,Junko,Trial 6,"Now then, will the hope of the Future Foundation win? Or will my despair win?",18,6,0,162,162,,,
00162,Junko,Trial 6,Alll right! Thingsh are shtarting to heat up!,18,6,0,163,163,,,
00163,Junko,Trial 6,"Au contraire, this is a game. A game of hope and despair that started with your killing school life.",18,6,0,164,164,,,
00164,Junko,Trial 6,That explains why these chumps who weren't around last time have been reduced to mere side characters.,18,6,0,165,165,,,
00165,Junko,Trial 6,Only cause it's trueee!,18,6,0,166,166,,,
00166,Junko,Trial 6,"Most importantly, the killing school trip wasn't just for your sake.",18,6,0,167,167,,,
00167,Junko,Trial 6,There was a more important goal there. The goal of luring a specific group of people.,18,6,0,168,168,,,
00168,Junko,Trial 6,"Ah, since now's a great time, why don't we make that the question?",18,6,0,169,169,,,
00169,Junko,Trial 6,As long as we're in the game world the rules say I gotta ask questions every now and then.,18,6,0,170,170,,,
00170,Junko,Trial 6,Sooo question: Who did I lure and how did I do it?,18,6,0,171,171,,,
00171,Junko,Trial 6,"The hint is, I get bored easily. So the same outcome as the killing school life would be a pain in the ass.",18,6,0,172,172,,,
00172,Junko,Trial 6,"Okie-dokie, let's all think about it together!",18,6,0,173,173,,,
00173,Junko,Trial 6,Ding-ding-ding! I was broadcasting the killing school trip live to every member of the Future Foundation.,18,6,0,174,174,,,
00174,Junko,Trial 6,"And you came all the way here when you knew it was a trap. I get it, you couldn't just leave them alone...",18,6,0,175,175,,,
00175,Junko,Trial 6,"If you saw people dying one by one with your own eyes, by the same killing game you guys played...",18,6,0,176,176,,,
00176,Junko,Trial 6,"...hope dictates that you act all high-and-mighty and say ""Ooh, I'm definitely gonna stop it this time!"", right?",18,6,0,177,177,,,
00177,Junko,Trial 6,Of course we made you do it for that reason!,18,6,0,178,178,,,
00178,Junko,Trial 6,We orchestrated this game instead of killing you outright solely to show it off to the Future Foundation.,18,6,0,179,179,,,
00179,Junko,Trial 6,"That's why you guys are chumps! You're just the bait I used to catch the big fish, called the Future Foundation.",18,6,0,180,180,,,
00180,Junko,Trial 6,"But it's not my fault, you know?",18,6,0,181,181,,,
00181,Junko,Trial 6,This game is a fight between the Future Foundation and me. You guys were just instigators in the background.,18,6,0,182,182,,,
00182,Junko,Trial 6,"But you guys already knew that when you chose to play this game, right?",18,6,0,183,183,,,
00183,Junko,Trial 6,"""As though we wanted to come to this world  of our own free will."" That's precisely the truth!",18,6,0,184,184,,,
00184,Junko,Trial 6,You guys chose to be instigators and you were willingly taken into the Neo World Program.,18,6,0,185,185,,,
00185,Junko,Trial 6,To provide the opportunity I needed to push this battle between hope and despair into overtime.,18,6,0,186,186,,,
00186,Junko,Trial 6,"That's right, the reason the Ultimate Despairs began killing each other was set up by the group itself.",18,6,0,187,187,,,
00187,Junko,Trial 6,"Ahhh, naive Makoto toootally fell for the trap! Ohoh, and now your face is filled with the lovely shade of despair!",18,6,0,188,188,,,
00188,Junko,Trial 6,"Whoa, that despair is fucking obvious! You're here to rescue the asshole who set this up in the first place!",18,6,0,189,189,,,
00189,Junko,Trial 6,"Thank youuu! It's all thanks to you guys! This time around, I might be able to fill these guys with despair.",18,6,0,190,190,,,
00190,Junko,Trial 6,"You're pretty fucking desperate! Well, that's pretty fucking obvious.",18,6,0,191,191,,,
00191,Junko,Trial 6,If you don't initiate the shutdown those Future Foundation fuckwits are gonna be trapped here forever.,18,6,0,192,192,,,
00192,Junko,Trial 6,"Puhuhuhuhu! Didn't I already explain it? You know, the Graduation Exam rule?",18,6,0,193,193,,,
00193,Junko,Trial 6,"But that's not all, right? In order to pass the Graduation Exam there was one more requirement.",18,6,0,194,194,,,
00194,Junko,Trial 6,"Obviously, there was no way I'd let the members of the Future Foundation graduate.",18,6,0,195,195,,,
00195,Junko,Trial 6,So if you can't activate the shutdown the Foundation will enter the endless life of repeating the gradeee!,18,6,0,196,196,,,
00196,Junko,Trial 6,Ohh?,18,6,0,197,197,,,
00197,Junko,Trial 6,That's my line. Thinking your little shutdown plan will succeed is a huge mistake.,18,6,0,198,198,,,
00198,Junko,Trial 6,You're totally overestimating those  chumps over there. There's no way they'll start the shutdown sequence.,18,6,0,199,199,,,
00199,Junko,Trial 6,Look upon their faces!,18,6,0,200,200,,,
00200,Junko,Trial 6,They look like piglets who were forced to watch their mom roasting on a spit.,18,6,0,201,201,,,
00201,Junko,Trial 6,There's no fucking way they'll initiate the shutdown just to go back to being Ultimate Despair.,18,6,0,202,202,,,
00202,Junko,Trial 6,Kyahahahahahahahaha!,18,6,0,203,203,,,
00203,Junko,Trial 6,"I-I was totally waiting for a protagonist to fly in like that! When I crush you with despair, such ecstacy, ah!",18,6,0,204,204,,,
00204,Junko,Trial 6,...,18,6,0,205,205,,,
00205,Junko,Trial 6,"Ahh, wrong, wrong. I'm not the one who's gonna make you fall into despair.",18,6,0,206,206,,,
00206,Junko,Trial 6,That's the mastermind's job. And they'll be appearing very soon.,18,6,0,207,207,,,
00207,Junko,Trial 6,You should never make the last character who appears in a detective story turn out to be the mastermind.,18,6,0,208,208,,,
00208,Junko,Trial 6,"Buuut, I always fall into that pattern. So I was kinda worried about that.",18,6,0,209,209,,,
00209,Junko,Trial 6,"Oh well, let's bring him up with lots of energy! It's Mr. Izuru Kamukura!",18,6,0,210,210,,,
00210,Junko,Trial 6,"If you do not know, then please allow me. Providing hopelessly skilled explanations is a quirk of mine.",18,6,0,211,211,,,
00211,Junko,Trial 6,The reason Izuru's existence continues to be such a mystery is because the academy hid it.,18,6,0,212,212,,,
00212,Junko,Trial 6,"However, that prestigious student ended up killing 13 Student Council members at Hope's Peak Academy.",18,6,0,213,213,,,
00213,Junko,Trial 6,"Izuru is the killer responsible for Hope's Peak Academy's Bigges, Most Awful Event.",18,6,0,214,214,,,
00214,Junko,Trial 6,"Oh, you thought Junko Enoshima killed them? Oh, don't say such cruel things...",18,6,0,215,215,,,
00215,Junko,Trial 6,Izuru Kamukura is very much alive.,18,6,0,216,216,,,
00216,Junko,Trial 6,"Isn't that right, Hajime?",18,6,0,217,217,,,
00217,Junko,Trial 6,"Like I said, you're Izuru Kamukura.",18,6,0,218,218,,,
00218,Junko,Trial 6,"Alrighty, if you don't understand I'll explain it to you until you do understand.",18,6,0,219,219,,,
00219,Junko,Trial 6,You're Izuru Kamukura. You're Izuru Kamukura. You're Izuru Kamukura. You're Izuru Kamukura.You're-,18,6,0,220,220,,,
00220,Junko,Trial 6,That's right. Hajime is one of those Reserve Course drop-outs and has nooo talent whatsoever.,18,6,0,221,221,,,
00221,Junko,Trial 6,But the fact that he's really Izuru Kamukura makes all this much more hopeless.,18,6,0,222,222,,,
00222,Junko,Trial 6,"Good news, Hajime!",18,6,0,223,223,,,
00223,Junko,Trial 6,Even though you were marked for being a Reserve Course student...,18,6,0,224,224,,,
00224,Junko,Trial 6,...you had a talent all along: Ultimate Hope!,18,6,0,225,225,,,
00225,Junko,Trial 6,"It's true, it was a break-through plan. After all, it was a plan to create the perfect genius.",18,6,0,226,226,,,
00226,Junko,Trial 6,"For the longest time, the Hope Cultivation Plan was the earnest wish of Hope's Peak Academy.",18,6,0,227,227,,,
00227,Junko,Trial 6,"In fact, that's why the academy was established. Part of that plan was researching the talents of Ultimates.",18,6,0,228,228,,,
00228,Junko,Trial 6,"Because the plan was so important, they adopted the name of the academy's founder.",18,6,0,229,229,,,
00229,Junko,Trial 6,And called it: The Izuru Kamukura Project.,18,6,0,230,230,,,
00230,Junko,Trial 6,Just a little while ago they were finally able to reach the experimental stage of that plan.,18,6,0,231,231,,,
00231,Junko,Trial 6,"From there, they set their sights on the Reserve Course drop-outs to use them as... lab rats.",18,6,0,232,232,,,
00232,Junko,Trial 6,A plan to create talent artificially requires test subjects that are wholly lacking in talent.,18,6,0,233,233,,,
00233,Junko,Trial 6,"From that group of Reserve Course students, the one who was finally chosen was...",18,6,0,234,234,,,
00234,Junko,Trial 6,"...Hajime, who stands before you now!",18,6,0,235,235,,,
00235,Junko,Trial 6,Because you admired Hope's Peak Academy more than anybody else.,18,6,0,236,236,,,
00236,Junko,Trial 6,You still don't get it? You were used by the academy.,18,6,0,237,237,,,
00237,Junko,Trial 6,They exploited your feelings of admiration towards hope and talent just to use you as a lab rat.,18,6,0,238,238,,,
00238,Junko,Trial 6,"See, didn't I tell you? The moment you cling to talent and hope, despair has already set in.",18,6,0,239,239,,,
00239,Junko,Trial 6,"Annnd, after many shurprishes Hajime Hinata wash transhformed into... Izuru 1.0.",18,6,0,240,240,,,
00240,Junko,Trial 6,Unless you're willing to go to extremes it's impossible to change a normal person into a perfect genius.,18,6,0,241,241,,,
00241,Junko,Trial 6,"So naturally, they went to extremes.",18,6,0,242,242,,,
00242,Junko,Trial 6,"By directly interfering with his brain, Hope's Peak Academy transformed Hajime Hinata...",18,6,0,243,243,,,
00243,Junko,Trial 6,...into a completely different person whose specialty is talent itself known as... Izuru Kamukura.,18,6,0,244,244,,,
00244,Junko,Trial 6,"Eventually, Izuru became an Ultimate Despair thanks to me.",18,6,0,245,245,,,
00245,Junko,Trial 6,But all I did to Izuru was simply break his spirit.,18,6,0,246,246,,,
00246,Junko,Trial 6,That's nothing compared to what Hope's Peak Academy did to him. Not even close.,18,6,0,247,247,,,
00247,Junko,Trial 6,Seriously. It's scary how determined the researchers were to mess with the human brain that much.,18,6,0,248,248,,,
00248,Junko,Trial 6,Doing such inhumane acts that nobody else was capable of with such a calm mind and a steady hand...,18,6,0,249,249,,,
00249,Junko,Trial 6,I admire it so much it makes my mind numb!,18,6,0,250,250,,,
00250,Junko,Trial 6,"By the way, you're just a simple avatar right now. So even if you touch your head, you won't feel the scar.",18,6,0,251,251,,,
00251,Junko,Trial 6,"Like I said, he's not Hajime. He's a completely different person whose specialty is talent itself.",18,6,0,252,252,,,
00252,Junko,Trial 6,"All of his sense, emotions, thoughts and hobbies that interfere with acquiring talent have ben excised",18,6,0,253,253,,,
00253,Junko,Trial 6,All of his memories of the past have been forcefully repressed into the darkest recesses of his mind.,18,6,0,254,254,,,
00254,Junko,Trial 6,So that's why it's so surprising Hajime that even exists here at all! Even if he's just an avatar.,18,6,0,255,255,,,
00255,Junko,Trial 6,The Neo World Program must've dug up those memories and rebuilt his old personality from data from the past.,18,6,1,0,256,,,
00256,Junko,Trial 6,I cannot help but feel impressed that the Neo World Program was able to accomplish such a feat.,18,6,1,1,257,,,
00257,Junko,Trial 6,"But, as for Hajime, he probably would've been better off if he stayed erased.",18,6,1,2,258,,,
00258,Junko,Trial 6,He'll disappear.,18,6,1,3,259,,,
00259,Junko,Trial 6,All that will remain is Izuru Kamukura. An entirely different personality created by Hope's Peak Academy.,18,6,1,4,260,,,
00260,Junko,Trial 6,He will no longer be Hajime Hinata.,18,6,1,5,261,,,
00261,Junko,Trial 6,That's what you are. That's who Izuru Kamukura is.,18,6,1,6,262,,,
00262,Junko,Trial 6,"You're the one who brought me into this world. You're Izuru Kamukura, the mastermind who's behind all of this.",18,6,1,7,263,,,
00263,Junko,Trial 6,"Just so you know, as long as your brain has been messed with you can't undo it, no matter how hard you try.",18,6,1,8,264,,,
00264,Junko,Trial 6,"Have no way to be saved, you say? But you already know what you must do.",18,6,1,9,265,,,
00265,Junko,Trial 6,"In that case, the Hajime avatar will be uploaded into his real body.",18,6,1,10,266,,,
00266,Junko,Trial 6,"Sooo, Hajime will be safely reborn. Truly a royal road to a hopeless happy ending.",18,6,1,11,267,,,
00267,Junko,Trial 6,"Like, if you guys don't start the shutdown the Future Foundation will be trapped here.",18,6,1,12,268,,,
00268,Junko,Trial 6,I can't allow the Future Foundation to sacrifice themselves for the Ultimate Despairs.,18,6,1,13,269,,,
00269,Junko,Trial 6,"Jeez, you should've said so before! You guys aren't honest at all.",18,6,1,14,270,,,
00270,Junko,Trial 6,"""We have to protect the world from despair"", you say? Okay okay, that's getting so old.",18,6,1,15,271,,,
00271,Junko,Trial 6,Do you reaaally have to sacrifice yourselves just to protect the world in the first place?,18,6,1,16,272,,,
00272,Junko,Trial 6,What if the world's hope is different from your hope?,18,6,1,17,273,,,
00273,Junko,Trial 6,Even if the world was happy it's meaningless if you aren't happy.,18,6,1,18,274,,,
00274,Junko,Trial 6,"Plus, the Future Foundation wants to kill all the Ultimate Despairs, right?",18,6,1,19,275,,,
00275,Junko,Trial 6,Once you go back to Ultimate Despair the Future Foundations punishment time will activate.,18,6,1,20,276,,,
00276,Junko,Trial 6,It woul be absolutely dreaaadful if that were to happen.,18,6,1,21,277,,,
00277,Junko,Trial 6,"It's rather fucking hopeless, don't you think? Ahahahaha!",18,6,1,22,278,,,
00278,Junko,Trial 6,And can you guys even endure that?,18,6,1,23,279,,,
00279,Junko,Trial 6,Everything that happened here will just end up being a meaningless game.,18,6,1,24,280,,,
00280,Junko,Trial 6,"Everything you felt, awe, friendship, love, there won't even be save data left of it.",18,6,1,25,281,,,
00281,Junko,Trial 6,The girl you love and the guy you hate  grow weaker and skinnier each day they lay immobilized.,18,6,1,26,282,,,
00282,Junko,Trial 6,And in Hajime's case his very existence is going to disappear. All because of the academy he loves so much.,18,6,1,27,283,,,
00283,Junko,Trial 6,Will you be able to endure such despair? Who are you going to endure it for?,18,6,1,28,284,,,
00284,Junko,Trial 6,For people you've never met before? For people who don't even appreciate you?,18,6,1,29,285,,,
00285,Junko,Trial 6,Does that sound like hope to you?,18,6,1,30,286,,,
00286,Junko,Trial 6,So that's why you're telling them to start the shutdown sequence? To prevent that?,18,6,1,31,287,,,
00287,Junko,Trial 6,You're telling them to turn back into Ultimate Despair and lose all the memories they made in this world.,18,6,1,32,288,,,
00288,Junko,Trial 6,"Even among them, there are those who will simply cease to exist. And you're telling them to just ""deal with it""?",18,6,1,33,289,,,
00289,Junko,Trial 6,"Nonono, there is another way.",18,6,1,34,290,,,
00290,Junko,Trial 6,As long as they chose to graduate they can pass along their avatars' memories...,18,6,1,35,291,,,
00291,Junko,Trial 6,...and everyone here will be able to hold hands and keep on living.,18,6,1,36,292,,,
00292,Junko,Trial 6,"Well, everyone who died will be taken over by me but...",18,6,1,37,293,,,
00293,Junko,Trial 6,...don't you think that's a better fate than being a vegetable for the rest of their life?,18,6,1,38,294,,,
00294,Junko,Trial 6,...and which is true despair?,18,6,1,39,295,,,
00295,Junko,Trial 6,Everyone's hope is in conflict.,18,6,1,40,296,,,
00296,Junko,Trial 6,Such despair!,18,6,1,41,297,,,
00297,Junko,Trial 6,"Annnd, there's no answer. So you've chosen to make no choice at all.",18,6,1,42,298,,,
00298,Junko,Trial 6,"Jeez, once again this went exactly as I expected.",18,6,1,43,299,,,
00299,Junko,Trial 6,I get so hopelessly bored when everything goes according to plan.,18,6,1,44,300,,,
00300,Junko,Trial 6,"Oh well, since I have everyone's data I kinda figured things would play out like this.",18,6,1,45,301,,,
00301,Junko,Trial 6,"That is, unless something else hopelessly unpredictable happens.",18,6,1,46,302,,,
00302,Junko,Trial 6,"Well, I can say that. But the chance of something convenient happening is hopeless.",18,6,1,47,303,,,
00303,Junko,Trial 6,"After all, this is a game. A world where everything progresses with predetermined harmony.",18,6,1,48,304,,,
00304,Junko,Trial 6,"Fine, I guess it's okay. You don't have to force yourself to make a choice.",18,6,1,49,305,,,
00305,Junko,Trial 6,"A futureless future. Hm, I think it's fine if that exists too.",18,6,1,50,306,,,
00306,Junko,Trial 6,As long as you don't yearn for hope you'll never fall victim to despair.,18,6,1,51,307,,,
00307,Junko,Trial 6,That goes for me too. As long as I never yearn for despair I'll never need to hope for it.,18,6,1,52,308,,,
00308,Junko,Trial 6,"So, let's all free ourselves from this curse and stay here as the best of friends!",18,6,1,53,309,,,
00309,Junko,Trial 6,Let's immerse ourselves in this tropical island life forever and ever!,18,6,1,54,310,,,
00310,Junko,Trial 6,"Forever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever, and ever... and ever!",18,6,1,55,311,,,
00311,Junko,Trial 6,They're both hope and they're both despair!,18,6,1,56,312,,,
00312,Junko,Trial 6,A conclusion will never be fucking reached!,18,6,1,57,313,,,
00313,Junko,Trial 6,...,18,6,1,58,314,,,
00314,Junko,Trial 6,Huh? Who the hell are you?,18,6,1,59,315,,,
00315,Junko,Trial 6,D-don't tell me- Izuru?,18,6,1,60,316,,,
00316,Junko,Trial 6,"Hey, what the heck is going on? I-is th-this a serious bug or something?",18,6,1,61,317,,,
00317,Junko,Trial 6,You despair because you yearn for hope!,18,6,1,62,318,,,
00318,Junko,Trial 6,You yearn for hope because you despair!,18,6,1,63,319,,,
00319,Junko,Trial 6,Let's finish this already!,18,6,1,64,320,,,
00320,Junko,Trial 6,There's no need for you to choose!,18,6,1,65,321,,,
00321,Junko,Trial 6,Close your eyes and cover your ears!,18,6,1,66,322,,,
00322,Junko,Trial 6,Just shut the hell up!,18,6,1,67,323,,,
00323,Junko,Trial 6,If you do that this game is gonna continue forever!,18,6,1,68,324,,,

00366,Teruteru,Trial 1,Then... was that knife inside the case too?,5,1,0,3,3,,,
00367,Teruteru,Trial 1,If there were night vision goggles inside it wouldn't be weird for a knife to be in there too.,5,1,0,4,4,,,

00388,Teruteru,Trial 1,R-really? B-but... it sounds like a riddle.,5,1,0,25,25,,,

00393,Teruteru,Trial 1,"So, was there anyone who was able to do that?",5,1,0,30,30,,,
00394,Teruteru,Trial 1,I was in the kitchen for a long time but I frequently went to the dining hall to deliver my dishes.,5,1,0,31,31,,,
00395,Teruteru,Trial 1,Then they could've stared at panties all day!,5,1,0,32,32,,,
00396,Teruteru,Trial 1,...without going to the storage room in the dark!,5,1,0,33,33,,,
00397,Teruteru,Trial 1,Maybe there really is a secret passage to go under the floorboards from outside and he came to spy...,5,1,0,34,34,,,
00398,Teruteru,Trial 1,"Oh, nohohahahaha!",5,1,0,35,35,,,
00399,Teruteru,Trial 1,But walking down that dark hallway to the storage room is like trying to make Egg Benedict without any eggs.,5,1,0,36,36,,,
00400,Teruteru,Trial 1,The hallway was really dark during the blackout.,5,1,0,37,37,,,
00401,Teruteru,Trial 1,Moving to the storage room like that...,5,1,0,38,38,,,
00402,Teruteru,Trial 1,...is like making a seafood bowl without fish!,5,1,0,39,39,,,
00403,Teruteru,Trial 1,A hole? What kind of hole? It would be great if you could explain it to me in... much more detail.,5,1,0,40,40,,,

00407,Teruteru,Trial 1,"O-objection or not, why am I being treated like the killer?",5,1,0,44,44,,,
00408,Teruteru,Trial 1,That's it? That's the only reason you're treating me like a killer? Isn't that a little drastic?,5,1,0,45,45,,,
00409,Teruteru,Trial 1,You're cruel! Cruel! Too cruel!,5,1,0,46,46,,,

00416,Teruteru,Trial 1,Th-th-that's right! That's exactly it.,5,1,0,53,53,,,
00417,Teruteru,Trial 1,I-I thought the blackout was only in the kitchen. So I panicked at ran out of there.,5,1,0,54,54,,,
00418,Teruteru,Trial 1,Of course the hallway was dark too but somehow I managed to move along the wall toward everyone's voices.,5,1,0,55,55,,,
00419,Teruteru,Trial 1,If I remember correctly you can tell when a person is lying by licking their sweat.,5,1,0,56,56,,,

00545,Teruteru,Bonus,My cooking was just... for the sake of making the person most important to me... smile.,5,99,0,75,75,,,
00546,Teruteru,Bonus,Why did I forget something as important as this?,5,99,0,76,76,,,
00547,Teruteru,CG,"He-ey, I got some suntan lotion from the super market! Would anyone like a rub-down?",5,99,0,101,101,,,
00548,Teruteru,CG,Eh? Rubbing lotion on a muscular man...,5,99,0,102,102,,,
00549,Teruteru,CG,"Alright, no problem. My tastes are pretty open, y'know?",5,99,0,103,103,,,
00550,Teruteru,CG,"Ehehehe, I'll make sure to slather you with lots and lots of oil...",5,99,0,104,104,,,

00554,Teruteru,CG,That is what I cook: The world's tastiest dishes.,5,99,0,108,108,,,
00555,Teruteru,CG,"I'll make lost more in the kitchen and then I'll bring it all out here, okay?",5,99,0,109,109,,,
00556,Teruteru,CG,"Okay, I'm goin' now.",5,99,0,110,110,,,
00557,Teruteru,CG,When I come back I think we shoul' talk again about openin' an Aoyama and Azabu location.,5,99,0,111,111,,,
00558,Teruteru,CG,"Oo-I'm serious. The academy guarantees success for its graduates, right?",5,99,0,112,112,,,
00559,Teruteru,CG,"So, I know it's gonna be difficult by yourself but... wait for me until then, okay?",5,99,0,113,113,,,
00560,Teruteru,CG,"Mom, you don't have to work so hard... What if you collapse again while I'm gone?",5,99,0,114,114,,,

00562,Teruteru,CG,I... I know that... already...,5,99,0,116,116,,,
00563,Teruteru,CG,You guys? Where are you? W-wasn't the blackout just... in the kitchen?,5,99,0,117,117,,,
00564,Teruteru,CG,"Ge-heee! The smell is to die for, and it's perfectly ripe. It tastes like the Kalakaua road at night!",5,99,0,118,118,,,
00565,Hajime,Trial 1,...,0,1,0,1,1,,,
00566,Hajime,Trial 1,"No, I don't think the killer moved the body.",0,1,0,2,2,,,
00567,Hajime,Trial 1,Byakuya was probably killed under the table.,0,1,0,3,3,,,
00568,Hajime,Trial 1,It probably has something to do with the knife we found under the table.,0,1,0,4,4,,,
00569,Hajime,Trial 1,Byakuya probably noticed the knife was hidden there.,0,1,0,5,5,,,
00570,Hajime,Trial 1,"So in order to get it, he moved under the table.",0,1,0,6,6,,,
00571,Hajime,Trial 1,"No, Byakuya the only one who was able to see in the dark.",0,1,0,7,7,,,
00572,Hajime,Trial 1,"If he was using those night vision goggles we found under the table, he could've seen what was happening.",0,1,0,8,8,,,
00573,Hajime,Trial 1,"Yeah, that seems to be the case.",0,1,0,9,9,,,
00574,Hajime,Trial 1,O-other way around?,0,1,0,10,10,,,
00575,Hajime,Trial 1,Where's your proof that the killer used them?,0,1,0,11,11,,,
00576,Hajime,Trial 1,Can... I hear your opinion one more time?,0,1,0,12,12,,,
00577,Hajime,Trial 1,"No, Byakuya was definitely the one who brought those night vision goggles.",0,1,0,13,13,,,
00578,Hajime,Trial 1,Inside the duralumin case Byakuya had with him during the party...,0,1,0,14,14,,,
00579,Hajime,Trial 1,...we found a smaller case for storing the night vision goggles.,0,1,0,15,15,,,
00580,Hajime,Trial 1,"Plus, Byakuya was the only one who could've taken the night vision goggles out of the case...",0,1,0,16,16,,,
00581,Hajime,Trial 1,...since he was carrying it around before the blackout in the first place.,0,1,0,17,17,,,
00582,Hajime,Trial 1,There was duct tape left under the table where the body was found.,0,1,0,18,18,,,
00583,Hajime,Trial 1,They probably hid the knife by duct taping it to the underside of the table!,0,1,0,19,19,,,
00584,Hajime,Trial 1,"Everyone, can you please take a look at this?",0,1,0,20,20,,,
00585,Hajime,Trial 1,It looks like a threatening letter someone sent to him.,0,1,0,21,21,,,
00586,Hajime,Trial 1,What if the glowing paint was the mark? With that you'd be able to get the knife even in the dark.,0,1,0,22,22,,,
00587,Hajime,Trial 1,"In actuality, the knife we found under the table...",0,1,0,23,23,,,
00588,Hajime,Trial 1,"...and the duct tape stuck to the underside of the table were both marked with glowing paint, right?",0,1,0,24,24,,,
00589,Hajime,Trial 1,"No, I think Peko is telling the truth.",0,1,0,25,25,,,
00590,Hajime,Trial 1,I-it's nothing like that at all! Nekomaru's account is actually Peko's alibi.,0,1,0,26,26,,,
00591,Hajime,Trial 1,"Everyone else besides Peko was in the dining hall after the party started, right?",0,1,0,27,27,,,
00592,Hajime,Trial 1,"Seriously, stop it.",0,1,0,28,28,,,
00593,Hajime,Trial 1,"No, it's impossible that laxatives were slipped into the food in the dining hall.",0,1,0,29,29,,,
00594,Hajime,Trial 1,"Because, Peko wasn't the only one who ate that food. Akane ate some of it too.",0,1,0,30,30,,,
00595,Hajime,Trial 1,It's just as Mahiru said! The blackout was caused by a power surge.,0,1,0,31,31,,,
00596,Hajime,Trial 1,Of course that's not a coincidence. Someone caused it intentionally.,0,1,0,32,32,,,
00597,Hajime,Trial 1,"When you found them right after the blackout the irons were still on, right?",0,1,0,33,33,,,
00598,Hajime,Trial 1,"Yeah, it seems that's how the killer caused the blackout!",0,1,0,34,34,,,
00599,Hajime,Trial 1,What the heck?,0,1,0,35,35,,,
00600,Hajime,Trial 1,"No, just because people were in the dining hall...",0,1,0,36,36,,,
00601,Hajime,Trial 1,...doesn't mean they're not a suspect!,0,1,0,37,37,,,
00602,Hajime,Trial 1,The irons are just one reason the blackout occurred but they weren't the direct trigger.,0,1,0,38,38,,,
00603,Hajime,Trial 1,The direct trigger was when the air conditioners in the dining hall and office clicked on.,0,1,0,39,39,,,
00604,Hajime,Trial 1,The timers for both air conditioners were set for 11:30 PM.,0,1,0,40,40,,,
00605,Hajime,Trial 1,N-Nagito? What happened to you?,0,1,0,41,41,,,
00606,Hajime,Trial 1,"Well, you have been saying this whole time that there's no way a killer could be among us.",0,1,0,42,42,,,
00607,Hajime,Trial 1,Y-you're changing your story again?,0,1,0,43,43,,,
00608,Hajime,Trial 1,"Nagito, there's definitely something wrong with you!",0,1,0,44,44,,,
00609,Hajime,Trial 1,Everyone calm down!,0,1,0,45,45,,,
00610,Hajime,Trial 1,Then why did Byakuya die?,0,1,0,46,46,,,
00611,Hajime,Trial 1,Let's try examining the situation. Mahiru's diagram might be useful here.,0,1,0,47,47,,,
00612,Hajime,Trial 1,...,0,1,0,48,48,,,
00613,Hajime,Trial 1,The killer must've used the desk lamp to move to that table in the dark.,0,1,0,49,49,,,
00614,Hajime,Trial 1,"They didn't turn the desk lamp on, they used its power cord.",0,1,0,50,50,,,
00615,Hajime,Trial 1,"They could've felt their way to that table using the power cord, right?",0,1,0,51,51,,,
00616,Hajime,Trial 1,"By doing that, the killer was able to move to the table, then use the glowing paint to find the knife.",0,1,0,52,52,,,
00617,Hajime,Trial 1,"Nagito, it was you, wasn't it?",0,1,0,53,53,,,
00618,Hajime,Trial 1,"Judging from everyone's position during the blackout, the only person near the power cord was you.",0,1,0,54,54,,,
00619,Hajime,Trial 1,"Nagito, weren't you cleaning the dining hall all morning?",0,1,0,55,55,,,
00620,Hajime,Trial 1,"If so, you would've had a chance to hide the knife.",0,1,0,56,56,,,
00621,Hajime,Trial 1,"If you factor in the power cord and the time you spent cleaning, you're the only one who could've done it.",0,1,0,57,57,,,
00622,Hajime,Trial 1,"Nagito, tell me you object to this. Frankly, I don't wanna believe it either.",0,1,0,58,58,,,
00623,Hajime,Trial 1,We investigated together! You were so kind. I can't believe you were the one who killed Byakuya!,0,1,0,59,59,,,
00624,Hajime,Trial 1,"Nagito, say something!",0,1,0,60,60,,,
00625,Hajime,Trial 1,Huh?,0,1,0,61,61,,,
00626,Hajime,Trial 1,You're the Ultimate Lucky student. Then... Did you...?,0,1,0,62,62,,,
00627,Hajime,Trial 1,...,0,1,0,63,63,,,
00628,Hajime,Trial 1,E-enough! I don't care about that anymore!,0,1,0,64,64,,,
00629,Hajime,Trial 1,"More importantly, why did you kill Byakuya? Answer me!",0,1,0,65,65,,,
00630,Hajime,Trial 1,"That knife might not be the murder weapon. That's what you wanted me to say, right Mikan?",0,1,0,66,66,,,
00631,Hajime,Trial 1,Hiding?,0,1,0,67,67,,,
00632,Hajime,Trial 1,"No, that's not it.",0,1,0,68,68,,,
00633,Hajime,Trial 1,"Even if we couldn't see what happened in the dark, I'm pretty sure someone could've heard it.",0,1,0,69,69,,,
00634,Hajime,Trial 1,"Isn't that right, Ibuki?",0,1,0,70,70,,,
00635,Hajime,Trial 1,"You were the one who told me, remember? How everyone was shouting during the blackout?",0,1,0,71,71,,,
00636,Hajime,Trial 1,...,0,1,0,72,72,,,
00637,Hajime,Trial 1,"Are you trying to say something like ""Why didn't Nagito have any bloodstains on him?""?",0,1,0,73,73,,,
00638,Hajime,Trial 1,"You're talking about the bloodstained tablecloth we found in the storage room, right?",0,1,0,74,74,,,
00639,Hajime,Trial 1,"That's true, the tablecloth was pretty big. So even if you tried to hide it and take it with you...",0,1,0,75,75,,,
00640,Hajime,Trial 1,I feel like I'm onto something but... it's still not clear what that is.,0,1,0,76,76,,,
00641,Hajime,Trial 1,...,0,1,0,77,77,,,
00642,Hajime,Trial 1,I've got it! The killer must've stabbed Byakuya from under the floorboard!,0,1,0,78,78,,,
00643,Hajime,Trial 1,The floorboards in the old building were full of gaps and there was no carpet laid out under the table!,0,1,0,79,79,,,
00644,Hajime,Trial 1,If they stuck the weapon through one of the gaps they could've stabbed Byakuya to death.,0,1,0,80,80,,,
00645,Hajime,Trial 1,I don't know that yet but I have a feeling there's someone here who does know.,0,1,0,81,81,,,
00646,Hajime,Trial 1,"Hey Gundham, you dropped your earring in the dining hall, right?",0,1,0,82,82,,,
00647,Hajime,Trial 1,About that earring...,0,1,0,83,83,,,
00648,Hajime,Trial 1,"About that Hellhound-Earring... You dropped it beneath the floorboards, right?",0,1,0,84,84,,,
00649,Hajime,Trial 1,Is it safe to say that... that earring is the one hanging from your right ear?,0,1,0,85,85,,,
00650,Hajime,Trial 1,Gundham wasn't wearing an earring during the investigation.,0,1,0,86,86,,,
00651,Hajime,Trial 1,And if he had it on during the time the class trial began...,0,1,0,87,87,,,
00652,Hajime,Trial 1,...then that means Gundham was able to retrieve his earring from beneath the floorboards during the investigation.,0,1,0,88,88,,,
00653,Hajime,Trial 1,"No, Fuyuhiko definitely has an alibi. Isn't that right, Chiaki?",0,1,0,89,89,,,
00654,Hajime,Trial 1,...,0,1,0,90,90,,,
00655,Hajime,Trial 1,But is it really impossible?,0,1,0,91,91,,,
00656,Hajime,Trial 1,It might be better if we examine that possibility a little bit more.,0,1,0,92,92,,,
00657,Hajime,Trial 1,"I know, the killer had a light with them!",0,1,0,93,93,,,
00658,Hajime,Trial 1,"There was one nearby for sure, see? It's written on the kitchen's equipment list.",0,1,0,94,94,,,
00659,Hajime,Trial 1,It's the portable stove!,0,1,0,95,95,,,
00660,Hajime,Trial 1,The portable stove isn't powered by electricity. And it's also small enough to carry around.,0,1,0,96,96,,,
00661,Hajime,Trial 1,"So, the killer used the portable stove to move from the hallway to the storage room during the blackout.",0,1,0,97,97,,,
00662,Hajime,Trial 1,I don't doubt what Kazuichi said!,0,1,0,98,98,,,
00663,Hajime,Trial 1,What are you trying to say?,0,1,0,99,99,,,
00664,Hajime,Trial 1,"Nagito, did you forget? Or are you just pretending you forgot?",0,1,0,100,100,,,
00665,Hajime,Trial 1,There should've been a wall that blocked light.,0,1,0,101,101,,,
00666,Hajime,Trial 1,I'm talking about the fire door in the hallway.,0,1,0,102,102,,,
00667,Hajime,Trial 1,"If you close it, it would form a perfect wall in the hallway.",0,1,0,103,103,,,
00668,Hajime,Trial 1,"Plus, the hallway rounds a corner just beyond the fire door.",0,1,0,104,104,,,
00669,Hajime,Trial 1,"So even if there was a small gap in the door, as long as they pass the corner the light still wouldn't peek out.",0,1,0,105,105,,,
00670,Hajime,Trial 1,Wh-who cares about right now?,0,1,0,106,106,,,
00671,Hajime,Trial 1,...,0,1,0,107,107,,,
00672,Hajime,Trial 1,"Teruteru, could it be you?",0,1,0,108,108,,,
00673,Hajime,Trial 1,"Of course that's simply my assumption. So if you have an objection, please speak freely.",0,1,0,109,109,,,
00674,Hajime,Trial 1,"Because, the portable stove used in the murder came from the kitchen.",0,1,0,110,110,,,
00675,Hajime,Trial 1,"Nagito, why are you interfering?",0,1,0,111,111,,,
00676,Hajime,Trial 1,Th-that's-!,0,1,0,112,112,,,
00677,Hajime,Trial 1,"The mark you're talking about is the glowing paint that was applied to the knife, right?",0,1,0,113,113,,,
00678,Hajime,Trial 1,"No, that's not it.",0,1,0,114,114,,,
00679,Hajime,Trial 1,It's not like I wanna blame you. I just...,0,1,0,115,115,,,
00680,Hajime,Trial 1,...,0,1,0,116,116,,,
00681,Hajime,Trial 1,Just because we heard Teruteru's voice in the dining hall doesn't mean he was literally in the dining hall.,0,1,0,117,117,,,
00682,Hajime,Trial 1,"Remember the floor in the dining hall? It was full of gaps, right?",0,1,0,118,118,,,
00683,Hajime,Trial 1,So even if you shouted from under the floor it should've sounded just like the voice is in the dining hall.,0,1,0,119,119,,,
00684,Hajime,Trial 1,I probably can.,0,1,0,120,120,,,
00685,Hajime,Trial 1,If you're claiming that you were in the dining hall while the power came back...,0,1,0,121,121,,,
00686,Hajime,Trial 1,"...then you should know how Mikan was positioned at the time, right?",0,1,0,122,122,,,
00687,Hajime,Trial 1,"No, this is a very important question.",0,1,0,123,123,,,
00688,Hajime,Trial 1,"Well, Teruteru? If you were really in the dining hall at that time, you should know the answer to that!",0,1,0,124,124,,,
00689,Hajime,Trial 1,It was a pretty clever way of tripping. There was no way you'd forget about it so easily.,0,1,0,125,125,,,
00690,Hajime,Trial 1,"Nagito, what are you doing? Why are you messing with the killer like that?",0,1,0,126,126,,,
00691,Hajime,Trial 1,That's it! The weapon must be the iron skewer!,0,1,0,127,127,,,
00692,Hajime,Trial 1,"Before the party, as Byakuya was confiscating all the dangerous items, he spoke to Teruteru.",0,1,0,128,128,,,
00693,Hajime,Trial 1,Could the iron skewer have been hidden inside the piece of meat on the bone?,0,1,0,129,129,,,
00694,Hajime,Trial 1,"Impossible, that's what Byakuya and I thought. That's why we overlooked it.",0,1,0,130,130,,,
00695,Hajime,Trial 1,"But in fact, the only place you could hide the weapon was inside the food that couldn't be inspected.",0,1,0,131,131,,,
00696,Hajime,Trial 1,"Out of all the dishes you prepared, the only one that could hide a weapon as long as an iron skewer is...",0,1,0,132,132,,,
00697,Hajime,Trial 1,...the meat on the bone!,0,1,0,133,133,,,
00698,Hajime,Trial 1,"So, we need to do it.",0,1,0,134,134,,,
00699,Hajime,Trial 1,"Let's try going over the whole incident, beginning with right after the party started.",0,1,0,135,135,,,
00700,Hajime,CR 1,Byakuya had us gather gather in the dining hall in the old building near the hotel.,0,1,0,136,136,,,
00701,Hajime,CR 1,He was extra cautious about a murder occurring that night because of a threatening letter he received.,0,1,0,137,137,,,
00702,Hajime,CR 1,"Therefore, he decided to throw a party so he could monitor us.",0,1,0,138,138,,,
00703,Hajime,CR 1,"Though one person didn't come, the rest of us assembled at the dining hall and the party was underway.",0,1,0,139,139,,,
00704,Hajime,CR 1,"But, at that time, the trap set by a certain someone was already in motion.",0,1,0,140,140,,,
00705,Hajime,CR 1,They plugged three irons into the outlets in the storage room which nearly capped the power usage.,0,1,0,141,141,,,
00706,Hajime,CR 1,Additionally they prepared something else that would activate at 11:30 PM.,0,1,0,142,142,,,
00707,Hajime,CR 1,The air conditioners in the office and dining hall. They had already set the timers for these.,0,1,0,143,143,,,
00708,Hajime,CR 1,"Thanks to the irons maxing out the power usage, the breaker was tripped when the air conditioners kicked on.",0,1,0,144,144,,,
00709,Hajime,CR 1,"Since the windows in the old building were covered, the blackout plunged the dining hall into total darkness.",0,1,0,145,145,,,
00710,Hajime,CR 1,"But when that happened, Byakuya took out a specific item that he brought in his case.",0,1,0,146,146,,,
00711,Hajime,CR 1,That item was the night vision goggle.,0,1,0,147,147,,,
00712,Hajime,CR 1,Byakuya was so concerned about a murder occurring that he brought a variety of security equipment with him.,0,1,0,148,148,,,
00713,Hajime,CR 1,"When he put on his night vision goggles, Byakuya witnessed a certain someone making a suspicious move.",0,1,0,149,149,,,
00714,Hajime,CR 1,He saw Nagito guiding himself with the desk lamp's power cord so he could get under the table.,0,1,0,150,150,,,
00715,Hajime,CR 1,"That's right, everything up to that point was all part of Nagito's plan.",0,1,0,151,151,,,
00716,Hajime,CR 1,"The murder warning to Byakuya, the source of the blackout, it was all Nagito.",0,1,0,152,152,,,
00717,Hajime,CR 1,"While the blackout was happening someone else, the real killer began making their move in the kitchen.",0,1,0,153,153,,,
00718,Hajime,CR 1,The killer probably already knew about Nagito's plan so they knew a blackout was coming.,0,1,0,154,154,,,
00719,Hajime,CR 1,That's why the killer prepared all the items to commit their crime in the dark beforehand.,0,1,0,155,155,,,
00720,Hajime,CR 1,They needed a light source which was provided by the portable stove in the kitchen.,0,1,0,156,156,,,
00721,Hajime,CR 1,They needed a weapon too. This had also been hidden in the kitchen beforehand.,0,1,0,157,157,,,
00722,Hajime,CR 1,The long iron skewer used in the churrasco dish. The killer hid that inside that meat with the bone in it.,0,1,0,158,158,,,
00723,Hajime,CR 1,"With the weapon and portable stove in hand, the killer stepped out into the hallway.",0,1,0,159,159,,,
00724,Hajime,CR 1,"First, they closed the fire door in the hallway so their light source wouldn't peek toward the dining hall.",0,1,0,160,160,,,
00725,Hajime,CR 1,"Then, guided by the light, the killer headed toward the storage room and grabbed a specific item.",0,1,0,161,161,,,
00726,Hajime,CR 1,"That's right, a tablecloth to block the blood splatter.",0,1,0,162,162,,,
00727,Hajime,CR 1,"With this, the killer finished their preparations and snuck under the floorboards through the secret passage.",0,1,0,163,163,,,
00728,Hajime,CR 1,They probably turned off the portable cooking stove at that point or left it near the entrance of the door.,0,1,0,164,164,,,
00729,Hajime,CR 1,The floor in the dining hall is full of gaps so there's no way they could've safely held a light source.,0,1,0,165,165,,,
00730,Hajime,CR 1,"But thanks to the glowing mark they painted earlier, the killer was able to get beneath the table.",0,1,0,166,166,,,
00731,Hajime,CR 1,"At that point, Byakuya had just stopped Nagito after seeing him do something suspicious.",0,1,0,167,167,,,
00732,Hajime,CR 1,"Under the table, Byakuya found the knife that had been hidden there.",0,1,0,168,168,,,
00733,Hajime,CR 1,"If only he had retreated he probably wouldn't have gotten killed, but...",0,1,0,169,169,,,
00734,Hajime,CR 1,...he had to retrieve that knife. And at that moment...,0,1,0,170,170,,,
00735,Hajime,CR 1,...the killer lurking beneath the floorboard stabbed straight up with the iron skewer!,0,1,0,171,171,,,
00736,Hajime,CR 1,The killer had been waiting in the dark for the moment the glowing paint began to move.,0,1,0,172,172,,,
00737,Hajime,CR 1,"After they murdered Byakuya, the killer...",0,1,0,173,173,,,
00738,Hajime,CR 1,...purposefully shouted from beneath the floorboards to make it seem like they were still in the dining hall.,0,1,0,174,174,,,
00739,Hajime,CR 1,"Afterward, they came out from underneath the floorboards and rushed back to the kitchen.",0,1,0,175,175,,,
00740,Hajime,CR 1,"And then, after hiding the murder weapon in the kitchen, they rejoined the group as if nothing had happened.",0,1,0,176,176,,,
00741,Hajime,CR 1,There's only one person who would've been able to commit this crime.,0,1,0,177,177,,,
00742,Hajime,CR 1,Especially if that person is someone who'd think of an unexpected way to hide a weapon inside food.,0,1,0,178,178,,,
00743,Hajime,CR 1,"Isn't that right, Teruteru Hanamura?",0,1,0,179,179,,,
00744,Hajime,Trial 1,"That's what happened, how about it? Did I get anything wrong?",0,1,0,180,180,,,
00745,Hajime,Trial 2,Girl A is probably Mikan Tsumiki.,0,2,0,1,1,,,
00746,Hajime,Trial 2,That timid tone... That definitely sounds like Girl A.,0,2,0,2,2,,,
00747,Hajime,Trial 2,Based on the list of names on the staff role I can't think of anyone else who would be Girl A.,0,2,0,3,3,,,
00748,Hajime,Trial 2,Girl B was short and foul-mouthed. She's probably Hiyoko.,0,2,0,4,4,,,
00749,Hajime,Trial 2,Girl C is Ibuki.,0,2,0,5,5,,,
00750,Hajime,Trial 2,"Girl D is Mahiru, the victim in this case.",0,2,0,6,6,,,
00751,Hajime,Trial 2,"Aren't you Guy F, Fuyuhiko?",0,2,0,7,7,,,
00752,Hajime,Trial 2,"In the game Guy F, Kuzuryu, mentions that he has a little sister.",0,2,0,8,8,,,
00753,Hajime,Trial 2,This is what Guy F said in the game...,0,2,0,9,9,,,
00754,Hajime,Trial 2,It's pretty clear. There's no doubt that Guy F had a little sister.,0,2,0,10,10,,,
00755,Hajime,Trial 2,"Plus, the sister actually appeared in the game. That's why the name Kuzuryu appeared twice.",0,2,0,11,11,,,
00756,Hajime,Trial 2,The dead high school girl who was the first victim in the game is the only person I can think of.,0,2,0,12,12,,,
00757,Hajime,Trial 2,The reason Girl E was killed is because she killed the first victim in the game.,0,2,0,13,13,,,
00758,Hajime,Trial 2,I'm surprised you went to all this trouble.,0,2,0,14,14,,,
00759,Hajime,Trial 2,"First of all, the sound the girls heard wasn't the window breaking.",0,2,0,15,15,,,
00760,Hajime,Trial 2,A vase.,0,2,0,16,16,,,
00761,Hajime,Trial 2,"After the murder, a broken vase was discovered in the classroom next to the music room.",0,2,0,17,17,,,
00762,Hajime,Trial 2,I got it! The killer must've used gravel to attack the victim.,0,2,0,18,18,,,
00763,Hajime,Trial 2,What if the gravel was put into some sort of bag?,0,2,0,19,19,,,
00764,Hajime,Trial 2,"If the weapon is something that appeard in the game, then so is the bag.",0,2,0,20,20,,,
00765,Hajime,Trial 2,And the only thing I can think of is the school swimsuit.,0,2,0,21,21,,,
00766,Hajime,Trial 2,"If you tie the swimsuit like a bag and stuff it full of gravel, it'd make an effective weapon.",0,2,0,22,22,,,
00767,Hajime,Trial 2,"How about it, Monokuma? Are you satisfied now?",0,2,0,23,23,,,
00768,Hajime,Trial 2,The piece of vase that became an important clue in the music room murder... Girl D got rid of it.,0,2,0,24,24,,,
00769,Hajime,Trial 2,It should've been Guy F.,0,2,0,25,25,,,
00770,Hajime,Trial 2,I'm not sure the two events are unrelated. At the very least the killer has definitely played the game.,0,2,0,26,26,,,
00771,Hajime,Trial 2,"As proof, Mahiru who was killed in the beach house...",0,2,0,27,27,,,
00772,Hajime,Trial 2,...and Girl E who was killed in the game were both killed by a blow to the head wit a metal bat.,0,2,0,28,28,,,
00773,Hajime,Trial 2,There's no way we can ignore that connection.,0,2,0,29,29,,,
00774,Hajime,Trial 2,"Wait a minute, you should've been at the beach house, Hiyoko.",0,2,0,30,30,,,
00775,Hajime,Trial 2,"But these footprints in the sand in front of the beachouse, aren't they yours?",0,2,0,31,31,,,
00776,Hajime,Trial 2,"Only during your morning walk, huh? Will you still claim that after you take a look at this letter?",0,2,0,32,32,,,
00777,Hajime,Trial 2,The place where Hiyoko was hiding? Are you takling about the closet?,0,2,0,33,33,,,
00778,Hajime,Trial 2,...,0,2,0,34,34,,,
00779,Hajime,Trial 2,About that gummy... Did Hiyoko really drop it?,0,2,0,35,35,,,
00780,Hajime,Trial 2,It's true Hiyoko likes to eat gummies but she only eats a specific brand.,0,2,0,36,36,,,
00781,Hajime,Trial 2,Mahiru didn't block the door. Her death was instant.,0,2,0,37,37,,,
00782,Hajime,Trial 2,The killer of course. They're the one who blocked the door with Mahiru's body.,0,2,0,38,38,,,
00783,Hajime,Trial 2,That's why there were bloody drag marks left on the floor.,0,2,0,39,39,,,
00784,Hajime,Trial 2,Hey Fuyuhiko... Why do you keep insisting that Hiyoko is the killer?,0,2,0,40,40,,,
00785,Hajime,Trial 2,If Hiyoko moved the body...,0,2,0,41,41,,,
00786,Hajime,Trial 2,...then she should be covered in blood!,0,2,0,42,42,,,
00787,Hajime,Trial 2,"No, washing it off in the shower is impossible because the shower in the beach house was out of order.",0,2,0,43,43,,,
00788,Hajime,Trial 2,"Listen to me Fuyuhiko, Hiyoko mentioned this before.",0,2,0,44,44,,,
00789,Hajime,Trial 2,"Which means, Hiyoko can't change by herself. It's impossible for her to put on and take off her clothes.",0,2,0,45,45,,,
00790,Hajime,Trial 2,"This letter, doesn't it look like its contents are different from the letter Mahiru had?",0,2,0,46,46,,,
00791,Hajime,Trial 2,Mahiru's letter said to meet at 2:30 PM. But in Hiyoko's letter...,0,2,0,47,47,,,
00792,Hajime,Trial 2,It's also strange that both letters wanted to change their meeting spot to the beach house.,0,2,0,48,48,,,
00793,Hajime,Trial 2,It would be plausible if one of them said it. But for both letters to say the same thing?,0,2,0,49,49,,,
00794,Hajime,Trial 2,The killer must've forged both letters!,0,2,0,50,50,,,
00795,Hajime,Trial 2,"So based on what the letter said you went to the beach house at 2 PM, right Hiyoko?",0,2,0,51,51,,,
00796,Hajime,Trial 2,Let's stop. Believing every little thing Nagito says is a waste of time.,0,2,0,52,52,,,
00797,Hajime,Trial 2,Just as you thought?,0,2,0,53,53,,,
00798,Hajime,Trial 2,...,0,2,0,54,54,,,
00799,Hajime,Trial 2,You think the killer might've been hiding?,0,2,0,55,55,,,
00800,Hajime,Trial 2,"No, there should've been a place for them to hide. A place you didn't look, Hiyoko.",0,2,0,56,56,,,
00801,Hajime,Trial 2,The killer was probably hiding in the closet!,0,2,0,57,57,,,
00802,Hajime,Trial 2,"After you woke up you said you rushed out of there, right?",0,2,0,58,58,,,
00803,Hajime,Trial 2,Then you probably didn't look inside the closet very carefully.,0,2,0,59,59,,,
00804,Hajime,Trial 2,What about the surfboard case in the cloest? I'm pretty sure they could've hidden in there.,0,2,0,60,60,,,
00805,Hajime,Trial 2,"Yeah, they were quietly holding their breath and hiding very close to you.",0,2,0,61,61,,,
00806,Hajime,Trial 2,A-anyway... The killer hid silently and after making sure Hiyoko left...,0,2,0,62,62,,,
00807,Hajime,Trial 2,...they finally left the surfboard case.,0,2,0,63,63,,,
00808,Hajime,Trial 2,What's wrong with that?,0,2,0,64,64,,,
00809,Hajime,Trial 2,"If they just needed to wash off the blood, they didn't necessarily have to use the shower.",0,2,0,65,65,,,
00810,Hajime,Trial 2,They could've just as easily used something else.,0,2,0,66,66,,,
00811,Hajime,Trial 2,The drinks inside the refrigerator! Couldn't the killer have used those to wash off the blood?,0,2,0,67,67,,,
00812,Hajime,Trial 2,Wh-why?,0,2,0,68,68,,,
00813,Hajime,Trial 2,We can't assume they used just one drink.,0,2,0,69,69,,,
00814,Hajime,Trial 2,They could've used a bunch of them to wash it off!,0,2,0,70,70,,,
00815,Hajime,Trial 2,"Oh, there were water bottles inside the refrigerator.",0,2,0,71,71,,,
00816,Hajime,Trial 2,"That was after the incident, right? But before the incident there were water bottles in the fridge.",0,2,0,72,72,,,
00817,Hajime,Trial 2,And the killer took all of those water bottles and used them to wash the blood off their body.,0,2,0,73,73,,,
00818,Hajime,Trial 2,It's not a fallacy. There should've been evidence inside the trash can.,0,2,0,74,74,,,
00819,Hajime,Trial 2,"Evidence like a lot of thrown away water bottles. Isn't that right, Chiaki?",0,2,0,75,75,,,
00820,Hajime,Trial 2,...,0,2,0,76,76,,,
00821,Hajime,Trial 2,Hm?,0,2,0,77,77,,,
00822,Hajime,Trial 2,"Peko, is it you?",0,2,0,78,78,,,
00823,Hajime,Trial 2,I remember when we were all meeting up to go to the beach... Your appearance when you came to the diner...,0,2,0,79,79,,,
00824,Hajime,Trial 2,"If the killer really did wash the blood off with water bottles, they'd have to drench their entire body.",0,2,0,80,80,,,
00825,Hajime,Trial 2,But there were no towels in the beach house. And it would've taken a while for the water to fully air-dry.,0,2,0,81,81,,,
00826,Hajime,Trial 2,So you said you went swimming so you'd have a cover story!,0,2,0,82,82,,,
00827,Hajime,Trial 2,"Hold on, that's strange. Didn't you just say this earlier?",0,2,0,83,83,,,
00828,Hajime,Trial 2,You told me you didn't see anyone. Don't try to tell me you forgot about that.,0,2,0,84,84,,,
00829,Hajime,Trial 2,"If the roadside and beachside doors aren't an option, the only other thing I can think of is...",0,2,0,85,85,,,
00830,Hajime,Trial 2,"Well, nothing really. Except, that small window in the shower room!",0,2,0,86,86,,,
00831,Hajime,Trial 2,"Peko, you carry that bamboo sword on your back at all times, right?",0,2,0,87,87,,,
00832,Hajime,Trial 2,"If I recall correctly, you had it then too.",0,2,0,88,88,,,
00833,Hajime,Trial 2,Despite the fact that you had a swimsuit on you were still wearing your bamboo sword.,0,2,0,89,89,,,
00834,Hajime,Trial 2,"Yeah, Peko used that bamboo sword as a stepstool and escaped out the window.",0,2,0,90,90,,,
00835,Hajime,Trial 2,"Well Peko, do you have anything to say?",0,2,0,91,91,,,
00836,Hajime,Trial 2,F-Fuyuhiko? Why do you even care?,0,2,0,92,92,,,
00837,Hajime,Trial 2,"If she used her bamboo sword as a stepstool, she could've recovered it with her sword bag.",0,2,0,93,93,,,
00838,Hajime,Trial 2,When she leaned her sword against the wall as a stepstool she tied her sword bag to it.,0,2,0,94,94,,,
00839,Hajime,Trial 2,"And after she climbed up to the window, as long as she hauled the bag up toward her...",0,2,0,95,95,,,
00840,Hajime,Trial 2,...she would've been able to recover her bamboo sword.,0,2,0,96,96,,,
00841,Hajime,Trial 2,...,0,2,0,97,97,,,
00842,Hajime,Trial 2,J-justice?,0,2,0,98,98,,,
00843,Hajime,Trial 2,...,0,2,0,99,99,,,
00844,Hajime,Trial 2,P-Peko... Is this your true identity?,0,2,0,100,100,,,
00845,Hajime,Trial 2,Let's go over this incident one more time and then... let's end this!,0,2,0,101,101,,,
00846,Hajime,CR 2,The incident began this morning when Mahiru spoke to Hiyoko.,0,2,0,102,102,,,
00847,Hajime,CR 2,"Mahiru most likely played Twilight Snydrome Murder Case, the video game provided to us as the motive.",0,2,0,103,103,,,
00848,Hajime,CR 2,She probably wanted to discuss it with someone who also appeared in the game as a character.,0,2,0,104,104,,,
00849,Hajime,CR 2,Hiyoko accepted Mahiru's invitation and they promised to have a more detailed conversation about it later.,0,2,0,105,105,,,
00850,Hajime,CR 2,"However, someone else overheard their exchange. The killer!",0,2,0,106,106,,,
00851,Hajime,CR 2,The killer eavesdropped on their conversation and used their promise to devise a specific murder plan.,0,2,0,107,107,,,
00852,Hajime,CR 2,By preparing a specific item they planned to manipulate the two's actions.,0,2,0,108,108,,,
00853,Hajime,CR 2,That item was the letters. They sent fake letters to both Mahiru and Hiyoko.,0,2,0,109,109,,,
00854,Hajime,CR 2,The letter Mahiru received told her to come to the beach house at 2:30 PM.,0,2,0,110,110,,,
00855,Hajime,CR 2,And the letter Hiyoko received told her to come to the beach house at exactly 2 PM.,0,2,0,111,111,,,
00856,Hajime,CR 2,By providing different times the killer was able to lure them to the beach house separately.,0,2,0,112,112,,,
00857,Hajime,CR 2,"Hiyoko totally trusted that letter, showed up to the beach house at 2 PM, just liked it said...",0,2,0,113,113,,,
00858,Hajime,CR 2,...and was drugged into unconsciousness by the killer lying in wait.,0,2,0,114,114,,,
00859,Hajime,CR 2,"After putting Hiyoko to sleep, the killer immediately hid her inside the closet...",0,2,0,115,115,,,
00860,Hajime,CR 2,...so they could frame her as the killer later.,0,2,0,116,116,,,
00861,Hajime,CR 2,At 2:30 PM Mahiru arrived at the beach house.,0,2,0,117,117,,,
00862,Hajime,CR 2,She was completely unaware that she had been targeted for murder.,0,2,0,118,118,,,
00863,Hajime,CR 2,Approaching her from behind the killer struck the defenseless Mahiru with a specific weapon.,0,2,0,119,119,,,
00864,Hajime,CR 2,"The metal bat, that was left at the scene of the crime.",0,2,0,120,120,,,
00865,Hajime,CR 2,The bat was brought down onto the back of Mahiru's head and with that she took her last breath.,0,2,0,121,121,,,
00866,Hajime,CR 2,According to Mikan's autopsy Mahiru died instantly so she probably never knew who killed her.,0,2,0,122,122,,,
00867,Hajime,CR 2,"With that, the killer achieved their goal of killing Mahiru and began to tamper with the crime scene.",0,2,0,123,123,,,
00868,Hajime,CR 2,They dragged Mahiru's body so that it blocked the door leading to the road.,0,2,0,124,124,,,
00869,Hajime,CR 2,"Also, the mask found at the scene of the crime was something the killer personally left.",0,2,0,125,125,,,
00870,Hajime,CR 2,I'm not really sure why. My guess is it's something similar to a calling card.,0,2,0,126,126,,,
00871,Hajime,CR 2,That's how the crime scene we discovered was created.,0,2,0,127,127,,,
00872,Hajime,CR 2,"However, by moving Mahiru's body the killer got blood splatter on them.",0,2,0,128,128,,,
00873,Hajime,CR 2,"Plus, the shower room had no water because it was out of order. So they couldn't wash it off.",0,2,0,129,129,,,
00874,Hajime,CR 2,But the killer expected something like that to happen.,0,2,0,130,130,,,
00875,Hajime,CR 2,Instead of the shower the killer used something else to wash the blood off their body.,0,2,0,131,131,,,
00876,Hajime,CR 2,They used plastic water bottles that were inside the beach house refrigerator.,0,2,0,132,132,,,
00877,Hajime,CR 2,We can assume they carried the bottles to the shower room before the sequence of events had happened.,0,2,0,133,133,,,
00878,Hajime,CR 2,"In place of showering, they washed the blood off their body with water bottles instead.",0,2,0,134,134,,,
00879,Hajime,CR 2,"However, they had no choice but to dispose of the empty bottles in the beach house's trash can.",0,2,0,135,135,,,
00880,Hajime,CR 2,Littering is against the rules and it would've taken too much time to throw them away somewhere else.,0,2,0,136,136,,,
00881,Hajime,CR 2,After the killer washed off the blood they hid in a specific spot inside the closet Hiyoko was in.,0,2,0,137,137,,,
00882,Hajime,CR 2,That's right.,0,2,0,138,138,,,
00883,Hajime,CR 2,The killer hid inside the surfboard case that they had already emptied beforehand.,0,2,0,139,139,,,
00884,Hajime,CR 2,"They probably did that to make sure Hiyoko didn't mess with the evidence they planted, too.",0,2,0,140,140,,,
00885,Hajime,CR 2,After some time had passed the sleeping drug used on Hiyoko wore off and she woke up.,0,2,0,141,141,,,
00886,Hajime,CR 2,I can imagine how badly Hiyoko must've panicked when she came out of the closet.,0,2,0,142,142,,,
00887,Hajime,CR 2,"I mean, she made plans to see Mahiru who laid dead right in front of her.",0,2,0,143,143,,,
00888,Hajime,CR 2,From the shock and panic of being considered a murder suspect...,0,2,0,144,144,,,
00889,Hajime,CR 2,...Hiyoko fled from the beach house.,0,2,0,145,145,,,
00890,Hajime,CR 2,"However, Mahiru's body was blocking the roadside door so her only option was to flee toward the beach.",0,2,0,146,146,,,
00891,Hajime,CR 2,Because of that she left footprints in the sand. Everything was a trap set by the culprit to frame her!,0,2,0,147,147,,,
00892,Hajime,CR 2,After Hiyoko left the killer finally came out of the surfboard case...,0,2,0,148,148,,,
00893,Hajime,CR 2,...and placed a gummy that they brought with them to shift our suspicion toward Hiyoko.,0,2,0,149,149,,,
00894,Hajime,CR 2,"Ironically, placing that gummy is what helped clear our suspicion toward Hiyoko.",0,2,0,150,150,,,
00895,Hajime,CR 2,"Finally, the killer began preparing to escape from the beach house.",0,2,0,151,151,,,
00896,Hajime,CR 2,They couldn't risk leaving their footprints in the sand. So they escaped the beach house using a different route.,0,2,0,152,152,,,
00897,Hajime,CR 2,The small window in the shower room!,0,2,0,153,153,,,
00898,Hajime,CR 2,"However, that window was rather high up and can't be reached easily. Which is why the killer used...",0,2,0,154,154,,,
00899,Hajime,CR 2,...the bamboo sword they always carry with them.,0,2,0,155,155,,,
00900,Hajime,CR 2,"The killer took the bamboo sword out of its bag, tied the bag to the sword's handle...",0,2,0,156,156,,,
00901,Hajime,CR 2,...and used the sword as a stepstool to reach the small window while holding the sword bag in their hand.,0,2,0,157,157,,,
00902,Hajime,CR 2,As long as they were able to reach the window all they had to do was pull the bag to retrieve the sword.,0,2,0,158,158,,,
00903,Hajime,CR 2,And so the killer left the beach house and appeared before us as if nothing had happened.,0,2,0,159,159,,,
00904,Hajime,CR 2,"But, their wet hair and swimsuit didn't dry right away! There also weren't any towels at the beach house.",0,2,0,160,160,,,
00905,Hajime,CR 2,So when the killer met us with us they said they had been swimming for a while as an excuse.,0,2,0,161,161,,,
00906,Hajime,CR 2,"So how about it? This is the truth behind the incident you caused! Isn't that right, Peko Pekoyama?",0,2,0,162,162,,,
00907,Hajime,Trial 2,A-are you serious?,0,2,0,163,163,,,
00908,Hajime,Trial 2,That's right. According to what Sonia said...,0,2,0,164,164,,,
00909,Hajime,Trial 2,"If she had it translated that means it wasn't written in English, right?",0,2,0,165,165,,,
00910,Hajime,Trial 2,"Peko, you're not Sparkling Justice! There's no way that's possible.",0,2,0,166,166,,,
00911,Hajime,Trial 2,Would you be able to do that?,0,2,0,167,167,,,
00912,Hajime,Trial 2,"What do you mean? ""Fulfilled its purpose"", ""Too late""? What are you getting at?",0,2,0,168,168,,,
00913,Hajime,Trial 2,What do you mean?,0,2,0,169,169,,,
00914,Hajime,Trial 2,Are you talking about the Body Discovery Announcement?,0,2,0,170,170,,,
00915,Hajime,Trial 2,Is it Fuyuhiko?,0,2,0,171,171,,,
00916,Hajime,Trial 2,I didn't think it was necessary to confirm it if it didn't have anything to do with Mahiru's murder but...,0,2,0,172,172,,,
00917,Hajime,Trial 2,There's no doubt that game is based on actual events. That much is clear if you saw the ending price.,0,2,0,173,173,,,
00918,Hajime,Trial 2,The photos awared for beating the game are not actual in-game screenshots.,0,2,0,174,174,,,
00919,Hajime,Trial 2,They're all actual photos with the surrounding scenery cropped out.,0,2,0,175,175,,,
00920,Hajime,Trial 2,"You knew all along Fuyuhiko, didn't you?",0,2,0,176,176,,,
00921,Hajime,Trial 2,"You knew whether or not the first victim in the game was actually your little sister, right?",0,2,0,177,177,,,
00922,Hajime,Trial 2,Because... whoever beat the game first and received the ending price...,0,2,0,178,178,,,
00923,Hajime,Trial 2,"It was the envelope, right? The person who received the ending price... it was you, wasn't it?",0,2,0,179,179,,,
00924,Hajime,Trial 2,"""Young Master""?",0,2,0,180,180,,,
00925,Hajime,Trial 2,What the hell?,0,2,0,181,181,,,
00926,Hajime,Trial 3,"Then, let's start with when we split into the hospital team and motel team because of the despair disease. ",0,3,0,1,1,,,
00927,Hajime,Trial 3,"The hospital team consisted of Nagito, Ibuki and Akane, who were infected, and Mikan, Fuyuhiko and me.",0,3,0,2,2,,,
00928,Hajime,Trial 3,I woke up at my cottage on the day the incident happened.,0,3,0,3,3,,,
00929,Hajime,Trial 3,Mikan came by to wake me up and told me that Nagito had recovered from his symptoms.,0,3,0,4,4,,,
00930,Hajime,Trial 3,We immediately headed over to the hospital and after we confirmed his recovery...,0,3,0,5,5,,,
00931,Hajime,Trial 3,...I made Mikan rest in the on-call room because she hadn't slept all night while I waited in the hospital lobby.,0,3,0,6,6,,,
00932,Hajime,Trial 3,"And then, I saw the incoming signal light on the surveillance camera blinking before our schedule time.",0,3,0,7,7,,,
00933,Hajime,Trial 3,"When I pressed the button to turn on the monitor, what appeared on screen was...",0,3,0,8,8,,,
00934,Hajime,Trial 3,"...a video of someone wearing a hospital gown and a hemp bad on their head, climbing a stepladder!",0,3,0,9,9,,,
00935,Hajime,Trial 3,I-I tried to stop them of course!,0,3,0,10,10,,,
00936,Hajime,Trial 3,I rushed out of the hospital and ran to where the video was being recorded: the music venue.,0,3,0,11,11,,,
00937,Hajime,Trial 3,But it was too late!,0,3,0,12,12,,,
00938,Hajime,Trial 3,By the time I arrived the person wearing the hemp bag on their head was already hanging from the ceiling.,0,3,0,13,13,,,
00939,Hajime,Trial 3,I thought I should tell the others right away so I headed to the motel.,0,3,0,14,14,,,
00940,Hajime,Trial 3,Because it was close to the music venue and unlike the hospital there were more able-bodied people there.,0,3,0,15,15,,,
00941,Hajime,Trial 3,"At least, that's what I thought. The only person who came with me was Chiaki.",0,3,0,16,16,,,
00942,Hajime,Trial 3,After I heard from those two that Ibuki had disappeared I had a feeling that she was the person wearing the hemp bag.,0,3,0,17,17,,,
00943,Hajime,Trial 3,So I immediately led them to the music venue.,0,3,0,18,18,,,
00944,Hajime,Trial 3,That's when we heard the Body Discovery Announcement not once but twice in a row.,0,3,0,19,19,,,
00945,Hajime,Trial 3,"When we removed the hemp bag, just as we feared, it was Ibuki.",0,3,0,20,20,,,
00946,Hajime,Trial 3,L-lie? Why would I lie?,0,3,0,21,21,,,
00947,Hajime,Trial 3,Do you doubt me?,0,3,0,22,22,,,
00948,Hajime,Trial 3,I'm not the killer! I mean there's no way I'd be able to imitate that movie.,0,3,0,23,23,,,
00949,Hajime,Trial 3,Huh?,0,3,0,24,24,,,
00950,Hajime,Trial 3,"Nagito, what are you doing?",0,3,0,25,25,,,
00951,Hajime,Trial 3,"What warm-up? This isn't a game, you know?",0,3,0,26,26,,,
00952,Hajime,Trial 3,"Yeah, I'm positive.",0,3,0,27,27,,,
00953,Hajime,Trial 3,I couldn't have been gone for more than 10 minutes.,0,3,0,28,28,,,
00954,Hajime,Trial 3,Hold on a sec! There's also a possibility that the door was locked from the outside.,0,3,0,29,29,,,
00955,Hajime,Trial 3,There was a semi-transparent glob stuck to the venue door. Maybe that's what they used.,0,3,0,30,30,,,
00956,Hajime,Trial 3,That semi-transparent glob must've been glue.,0,3,0,31,31,,,
00957,Hajime,Trial 3,That glue was only applied to the areas where both doors touched.,0,3,0,32,32,,,
00958,Hajime,Trial 3,By pouring it in the gaps of the closed door they must've sealed the door from the outside!,0,3,0,33,33,,,
00959,Hajime,Trial 3,That scrap! Isn't it part of the wallpaper from the storage room?,0,3,0,34,34,,,
00960,Hajime,Trial 3,In the music venue storage room there should've been wallpaper that's the same color as that scrap.,0,3,0,35,35,,,
00961,Hajime,Trial 3,"There was also a tear along the edge of the wallpaper, wasn't there? If so...",0,3,0,36,36,,,
00962,Hajime,Trial 3,I got it! Hiyoko's body was hidden before we found it!,0,3,0,37,37,,,
00963,Hajime,Trial 3,"No, the body was already taped up and the killer hid it along with the pillar using the wallpaper.",0,3,0,38,38,,,
00964,Hajime,Trial 3,"Yeah, by wrapping the wallpaper around the pillar the killer was able to create a slightly larger pillar.",0,3,0,39,39,,,
00965,Hajime,Trial 3,"So when I first discovered Ibuki's body, Hiyoko's body was already there!",0,3,0,40,40,,,
00966,Hajime,Trial 3,"However, because it was concealed within a slightly larger pillar I didn't realize that at the time!",0,3,0,41,41,,,
00967,Hajime,Trial 3,That's how they hid Hiyoko's body and then peeled off the wallpaper as soon as I left the music venue.,0,3,0,42,42,,,
00968,Hajime,Trial 3,The reason the killer imitated two of the murders from the movie was so we'd mix up the killing order.,0,3,0,43,43,,,
00969,Hajime,Trial 3,"Just as Sonia said, Ibuki stepped on something.",0,3,0,44,44,,,
00970,Hajime,Trial 3,"That ""something"" was blood. There were faint bloodstains on the soles of her slippers.",0,3,0,45,45,,,
00971,Hajime,Trial 3,It means Ibuki was still standing when Ibuki was mortally wounded.,0,3,0,46,46,,,
00972,Hajime,Trial 3,Which means Ibuki was still alive at the exact moment Hiyoko was killed!,0,3,0,47,47,,,
00973,Hajime,Trial 3,D-does that mean you have a rebuttal?,0,3,0,48,48,,,
00974,Hajime,Trial 3,...,0,3,0,49,49,,,
00975,Hajime,Trial 3,As long as  Ibuki's body has no open wounds...,0,3,0,50,50,,,
00976,Hajime,Trial 3,...there's no doubt that that blood is Hiyoko's!,0,3,0,51,51,,,
00977,Hajime,Trial 3,That's not it. The reason there was no blood on the floor is because the killer wiped it away afterward.,0,3,0,52,52,,,
00978,Hajime,Trial 3,"Yes, I do.",0,3,0,53,53,,,
00979,Hajime,Trial 3,If you look closely there's a streak on the floor where blood was wiped away.,0,3,0,54,54,,,
00980,Hajime,Trial 3,If the time of death wasn't mentioned in the Monokuma File just to keep concrete evidence from us...,0,3,0,55,55,,,
00981,Hajime,Trial 3,"I saw it at the hospital, right before Monokuma's morning announcement.",0,3,0,56,56,,,
00982,Hajime,Trial 3,And I saw the body at the music venue a little after Monokuma's announcement.,0,3,0,57,57,,,
00983,Hajime,Trial 3,"Hold on, not all of us are missing an alibi!",0,3,0,58,58,,,
00984,Hajime,Trial 3,"In fact, Mikan and I both have alibis!",0,3,0,59,59,,,
00985,Hajime,Trial 3,"Up until I saw that hanging video, Mikan and I were actually together for a while.",0,3,0,60,60,,,
00986,Hajime,Trial 3,I-it's not like that! She just came to tell me Nagito's condition had improved!,0,3,0,61,61,,,
00987,Hajime,Trial 3,Are you saying there was another reason?,0,3,0,62,62,,,
00988,Hajime,Trial 3,...,0,3,0,63,63,,,
00989,Hajime,Trial 3,...,0,3,0,64,64,,,
00990,Hajime,Trial 3,"So, you're saying the truth behind Hiyoko's murder is hidden?",0,3,0,65,65,,,
00991,Hajime,Trial 3,It's just as Sonia said. She went to the music venue out of her own free will.,0,3,0,66,66,,,
00992,Hajime,Trial 3,Hiyoko locked the room she was staying in before she went out!,0,3,0,67,67,,,
00993,Hajime,Trial 3,Then they couldn't have hidden her room key that deep in her kimono. They would've put it somewhere more obvious.,0,3,0,68,68,,,
00994,Hajime,Trial 3,Otherwise there's no point in messing with the crime scene if nobody finds the key.,0,3,0,69,69,,,
00995,Hajime,Trial 3,"At the time you were the one who actually took out the key, right? Then something like that...",0,3,0,70,70,,,
00996,Hajime,Trial 3,N-no! That's not the issue!,0,3,0,71,71,,,
00997,Hajime,Trial 3,But Hiyoko's room was locked.,0,3,0,72,72,,,
00998,Hajime,Trial 3,"The key was deep inside her kimono, remember?",0,3,0,73,73,,,
00999,Hajime,Trial 3,It's more likely that Hiyoko locked the door herself.,0,3,0,74,74,,,
01000,Hajime,Trial 3,There's no reason for the killer to put the key in Hiyoko's kimono.,0,3,0,75,75,,,
01001,Hajime,Trial 3,The killer probably didn't realize she even had the key!,0,3,0,76,76,,,
01002,Hajime,Trial 3,The reason Hiyoko's kimono was messed up was because she wasn't able to properly wear it.,0,3,0,77,77,,,
01003,Hajime,Trial 3,"Yeah, it's also the reason why she decided to go out on her own.",0,3,0,78,78,,,
01004,Hajime,Trial 3,"Yeah, she went to the venue on her own just to fix her messed up kimono.",0,3,0,79,79,,,
01005,Hajime,Trial 3,That's the reason they imitated the movie to falsify the murder sequence.,0,3,0,80,80,,,
01006,Hajime,Trial 3,"Hey Nagito, any ideas?",0,3,0,81,81,,,
01007,Hajime,Trial 3,So what do you think?,0,3,0,82,82,,,
01008,Hajime,Trial 3,...,0,3,0,83,83,,,
01009,Hajime,Trial 3,That's strange... That's very strange...,0,3,0,84,84,,,
01010,Hajime,Trial 3,If Ibuki used the stepladder to hang herself it's strange that there weren't any footprints on it.,0,3,0,85,85,,,
01011,Hajime,Trial 3,"Yeah, that stepladder was completely clean. No footprints or bloodstains at all.",0,3,0,86,86,,,
01012,Hajime,Trial 3,"Yeah, I'll definitely try.",0,3,0,87,87,,,
01013,Hajime,Trial 3,"That's right, I remember now! There was definitely something strange about that video.",0,3,0,88,88,,,
01014,Hajime,Trial 3,What's strange is that stepladder I mentioned earlier.,0,3,0,89,89,,,
01015,Hajime,Trial 3,"It's true that the steps on that stepladder weren't dirty, but on one side...",0,3,0,90,90,,,
01016,Hajime,Trial 3,"...there was a bloodstain, right on the left side of the stepladder.",0,3,0,91,91,,,
01017,Hajime,Trial 3,"However, that contradicts the video I saw at the hospital.",0,3,0,92,92,,,
01018,Hajime,Trial 3,There weren't any bloodstains on the stepladder in the video. It was completely clean.,0,3,0,93,93,,,
01019,Hajime,Trial 3,"Even so, the fact is the stepladder had blood on it at the actual crime scene.",0,3,0,94,94,,,
01020,Hajime,Trial 3,But the stepladder in the video was completely bloodless.,0,3,0,95,95,,,
01021,Hajime,Trial 3,"That's right, besides the stepladder the filming location must've been different too!",0,3,0,96,96,,,
01022,Hajime,Trial 3,"I mean, the video I saw was not filmed at the music venue.",0,3,0,97,97,,,
01023,Hajime,Trial 3,It was filmed somewhere else!,0,3,0,98,98,,,
01024,Hajime,Trial 3,That's it! The killer just brought the camera from the music venue.,0,3,0,99,99,,,
01025,Hajime,Trial 3,"With it, they made me think it was a live feed from the venue when it was actually from somewhere else.",0,3,0,100,100,,,
01026,Hajime,Trial 3,"Yes, at least when I first discovered Ibuki's body.",0,3,0,101,101,,,
01027,Hajime,Trial 3,"But when Hiyoko's body appeared, the killer probably put the camera back too.",0,3,0,102,102,,,
01028,Hajime,Trial 3,"Well that's true, but...",0,3,0,103,103,,,
01029,Hajime,Trial 3,"In order to hide that the camera was missing, the killer did one more thing to the remaining monitor.",0,3,0,104,104,,,
01030,Hajime,Trial 3,"The killer smashed the monitor to pieces, destroying it.",0,3,0,105,105,,,
01031,Hajime,Trial 3,"As long as it was in pieces, you wouldn't be able to tell if the camera was actually there or not.",0,3,0,106,106,,,
01032,Hajime,Trial 3,My attention was so focused on the body that even I couldn't have noticed something like that.,0,3,0,107,107,,,
01033,Hajime,Trial 3,And they destroyed it and left that in pieces as well.,0,3,0,108,108,,,
01034,Hajime,Trial 3,It's possible that it was filmed in the hospital's conference room.,0,3,0,109,109,,,
01035,Hajime,Trial 3,That's exactly why the killer did something to make those two places resemble each other.,0,3,0,110,110,,,
01036,Hajime,Trial 3,What the killer did was...,0,3,0,111,111,,,
01037,Hajime,Trial 3,"...make the music venue, the crime scene, look like the conference room.",0,3,0,112,112,,,
01038,Hajime,Trial 3,They did that by using the black curtain hanging at the back of the stage.,0,3,0,113,113,,,
01039,Hajime,Trial 3,"You're referring to the candle in the music venue, right?",0,3,0,114,114,,,
01040,Hajime,Trial 3,"In the video I saw, a candle was used for lighting. But if you think about it that's pretty strange.",0,3,0,115,115,,,
01041,Hajime,Trial 3,The music venue has good lighting so there's no reason to even use candle light.,0,3,0,116,116,,,
01042,Hajime,Trial 3,That candle was likely placed there just to make me think it was the same candle that was used in the video.,0,3,0,117,117,,,
01043,Hajime,Trial 3,As long as this all matches up it should be no problem to say this is decided.,0,3,0,118,118,,,
01044,Hajime,Trial 3,"The video I saw wasn't filmed at the music venue, it was actually filmed at the hospital conference room!",0,3,0,119,119,,,
01045,Hajime,Trial 3,The person wearing the hemp bag in that video wasn't Ibuki.,0,3,0,120,120,,,
01046,Hajime,Trial 3,It was the killer pretending to be Ibuki!,0,3,0,121,121,,,
01047,Hajime,Trial 3,"The killer put on a hospital gown, wore a hemp bag on their head and was only pretending to be the victim.",0,3,0,122,122,,,
01048,Hajime,Trial 3,A reason the killer made a fake video...,0,3,0,123,123,,,
01049,Hajime,Trial 3,There's only one possibility I can think of. If I examine that possibility thouroughly...,0,3,0,124,124,,,
01050,Hajime,Trial 3,...then naturally the killer's identity will reveal itself.,0,3,0,125,125,,,
01051,Hajime,Trial 3,...,0,3,0,126,126,,,
01052,Hajime,Trial 3,"Mikan, you're the killer aren't you?",0,3,0,127,127,,,
01053,Hajime,Trial 3,"Like I said, aren't you the killer who murdered Ibuki and Hiyoko?",0,3,0,128,128,,,
01054,Hajime,Trial 3,"But, we're the only ones.",0,3,0,129,129,,,
01055,Hajime,Trial 3,Thanks to that video we're the only ones who have the advantage of an alibi.,0,3,0,130,130,,,
01056,Hajime,Trial 3,But you're the only one who could've filmed that video in the hospital conference room.,0,3,0,131,131,,,
01057,Hajime,Trial 3,Is that also a coincidence?,0,3,0,132,132,,,
01058,Hajime,Trial 3,"At that time, you said you were going to the on-call room. But you actually went to the conference room.",0,3,0,133,133,,,
01059,Hajime,Trial 3,"That's when you put on a hospital gown that you prepared in advance, put the bag on your head and began filming.",0,3,0,134,134,,,
01060,Hajime,Trial 3,"By doing that, you made up a video that showed Ibuki trying to hang herself at the music venue...",0,3,0,135,135,,,
01061,Hajime,Trial 3,...and showed that to me.,0,3,0,136,136,,,
01062,Hajime,Trial 3,"Furthermore, I saw that video at the hospital lobby.",0,3,0,137,137,,,
01063,Hajime,Trial 3,If someone wants to go to the conference room from outside they have to pass through the lobby.,0,3,0,138,138,,,
01064,Hajime,Trial 3,U-uhm...,0,3,0,139,139,,,
01065,Hajime,Trial 3,...,0,3,0,140,140,,,
01066,Hajime,Trial 3,Wh-what are you saying?,0,3,0,141,141,,,
01067,Hajime,Trial 3,"Hold on, I've been listening to you for a while and it sounds like you knew about this ""rope clue"" all along!",0,3,0,142,142,,,
01068,Hajime,Trial 3,What exactly did you say to me during the investigation?,0,3,0,143,143,,,
01069,Hajime,Trial 3,Huh?,0,3,0,144,144,,,
01070,Hajime,Trial 3,...,0,3,0,145,145,,,
01071,Hajime,Trial 3,So that's what happened! We've been falling for the killer's lie the whole time!,0,3,0,146,146,,,
01072,Hajime,Trial 3,"You said Ibuki hanged herself but that was a complete lie, wasn't it Mikan?",0,3,0,147,147,,,
01073,Hajime,Trial 3,"You told us the wrong cause of death. You lied, didn't you?",0,3,0,148,148,,,
01074,Hajime,Trial 3,...,0,3,0,149,149,,,
01075,Hajime,Trial 3,...,0,3,0,150,150,,,
01076,Hajime,Trial 3,Is that really true?,0,3,0,151,151,,,
01077,Hajime,Trial 3,I can't stop!,0,3,0,152,152,,,
01078,Hajime,Trial 3,I-I don't wanna do this either! Of course I don't wanna do this...,0,3,0,153,153,,,
01079,Hajime,Trial 3,But I need to do this!,0,3,0,154,154,,,
01080,Hajime,Trial 3,That's not it! I suspect them because I wanna believe them.,0,3,0,155,155,,,
01081,Hajime,Trial 3,...,0,3,0,156,156,,,
01082,Hajime,Trial 3,"Mikan, you've committed a major mistake.",0,3,0,157,157,,,
01083,Hajime,Trial 3,"As I said before many times, I'm the only one who saw that video.",0,3,0,158,158,,,
01084,Hajime,Trial 3,But I... never said anything about the camera angle.,0,3,0,159,159,,,
01085,Hajime,Trial 3,So how can you...,0,3,0,160,160,,,
01086,Hajime,Trial 3,...say anything about the camera angle as if you saw that video yourself?,0,3,0,161,161,,,
01087,Hajime,Trial 3,Monokuma mentioned this earlier.,0,3,0,162,162,,,
01088,Hajime,Trial 3,Whoever bought that bag should've received another one as a bonus price.,0,3,0,163,163,,,
01089,Hajime,Trial 3,Which means it's not impossible to use that bag in two separate places.,0,3,0,164,164,,,
01090,Hajime,Trial 3,"So please, just stop making desperate excuses!",0,3,0,165,165,,,
01091,Hajime,Trial 3,"Mikan, it's already over.",0,3,0,166,166,,,
01092,Hajime,Trial 3,After I go over your crime from the beginning and show that you have no arguments left...,0,3,0,167,167,,,
01093,Hajime,Trial 3,"Please, just admit it already! In the end, at least let me believe in you.",0,3,0,168,168,,,
01094,Hajime,CR 3,The key to this incident is the surveillance camera video that only I saw.,0,3,0,169,169,,,
01095,Hajime,CR 3,That's why I'm going to start with that to unravel the knots of this crime.,0,3,0,170,170,,,
01096,Hajime,CR 3,When I went to the hospital with Mikan this morning I noticed a specific thing in the lobby.,0,3,0,171,171,,,
01097,Hajime,CR 3,The incoming signal light on the surveillance monitor was blinking ahead of the scheduled time.,0,3,0,172,172,,,
01098,Hajime,CR 3,"When I switched on the monitor, what appeared on screen was...",0,3,0,173,173,,,
01099,Hajime,CR 3,...a person wearing a hospital gown and a bag on their head about to hang themselves right at that moment!,0,3,0,174,174,,,
01100,Hajime,CR 3,That surveillance camera unit was designed for two-way communication with the hospital and the music venue.,0,3,0,175,175,,,
01101,Hajime,CR 3,That's why I thought the signal originated from the music venue so I immediately headed over there.,0,3,0,176,176,,,
01102,Hajime,CR 3,But that was the killer's trap!,0,3,0,177,177,,,
01103,Hajime,CR 3,"In truth, that video was recorded in a different place.",0,3,0,178,178,,,
01104,Hajime,CR 3,The killer brought the music venue camera the night before and made their preparations in advance.,0,3,0,179,179,,,
01105,Hajime,CR 3,"And then, they filmed that video in the hospital conference room.",0,3,0,180,180,,,
01106,Hajime,CR 3,"By doing so, they tried to make me think the incident was happening in real time...",0,3,0,181,181,,,
01107,Hajime,CR 3,"...when in fact, the crime had already been committed by that point.",0,3,0,182,182,,,
01108,Hajime,CR 3,The person in the footage wearing the bag was actually the killer acting as a fake.,0,3,0,183,183,,,
01109,Hajime,CR 3,I didn't know that so I went to the music venue and found the hanged body wearing a bag on its head.,0,3,0,184,184,,,
01110,Hajime,CR 3,"Seeing the body before me, I panicked and rushed out of there to get the rest of you guys.",0,3,0,185,185,,,
01111,Hajime,CR 3,"But, that was also part of the killer's trap.",0,3,0,186,186,,,
01112,Hajime,CR 3,After cleaning the conference room the killer was likely watching the music venue from outside.,0,3,0,187,187,,,
01113,Hajime,CR 3,"And, as if they were switching places with me, they went inside the music venue...",0,3,0,188,188,,,
01114,Hajime,CR 3,...and began working on their last trick.,0,3,0,189,189,,,
01115,Hajime,CR 3,"First, the killer peeled off the wallpaper covering one of the stage pillars, revealing Hiyoko's body.",0,3,0,190,190,,,
01116,Hajime,CR 3,When I first arrived and saw the hanged body I didn't notice anything strange about that pillar.,0,3,0,191,191,,,
01117,Hajime,CR 3,I didn't expect it to be slightly larger from the wallpaper or have Hiyoko's body hidden inside.,0,3,0,192,192,,,
01118,Hajime,CR 3,"Next, the killer destroyed the surveillance camera that was used in the conference room.",0,3,0,193,193,,,
01119,Hajime,CR 3,"After destroying it, they mixed it with what was left of the surveillance monitor found at the crime scene.",0,3,0,194,194,,,
01120,Hajime,CR 3,"The surveillance camera the killer used was originally brought from the music venue, but...",0,3,0,195,195,,,
01121,Hajime,CR 3,...when they brought it they made sure to destroy its monitor beforehand.,0,3,0,196,196,,,
01122,Hajime,CR 3,They wanted to hide the fact that the camera wasn't at the crime scene!,0,3,0,197,197,,,
01123,Hajime,CR 3,"In the end, the killer transformed the crime scene into a closed room.",0,3,0,198,198,,,
01124,Hajime,CR 3,They broke one of the drumsticks from the storage room and placed it near the music venue's entrance.,0,3,0,199,199,,,
01125,Hajime,CR 3,"However, they did this to mislead us into believing that the music venue was locked from the inside.",0,3,0,200,200,,,
01126,Hajime,CR 3,"In actuality, the reason the music venue became a closed room was because of the glue.",0,3,0,201,201,,,
01127,Hajime,CR 3,The killer sealed the door with glue and intentionally created a closed room that could be forced open.,0,3,0,202,202,,,
01128,Hajime,CR 3,"With that, the killer finished tampering with the crime scene and met up with Fuyuhiko and me.",0,3,0,203,203,,,
01129,Hajime,CR 3,They helped us force open the music venue door despite the fact that they personally sealed it.,0,3,0,204,204,,,
01130,Hajime,CR 3,And they made us discover not just Ibuki's body but Hiyoko's suddenly present body as well.,0,3,0,205,205,,,
01131,Hajime,CR 3,"At the time, they pretended to be surprised but...",0,3,0,206,206,,,
01132,Hajime,CR 3,"...inside, they were probably relieved that their plan worked out.",0,3,0,207,207,,,
01133,Hajime,CR 3,"Isn't that right, Mikan? This crime was orchestrated by you, wasn't it?",0,3,0,208,208,,,
01134,Hajime,Trial 4,We just happened to run into each other on the first floor of Grape House and went to the tower together.,0,4,0,1,1,,,
01135,Hajime,Trial 4,"No, I can't accept that that hammer was the murder weapon.",0,4,0,2,2,,,
01136,Hajime,Trial 4,"A lot of oil was flowing from Nekomaru's body just like human blood, right?",0,4,0,3,3,,,
01137,Hajime,Trial 4,"If the hammer was used to beat Nekomaru, you'd expect some oil to be on it at least.",0,4,0,4,4,,,
01138,Hajime,Trial 4,The only thing with oil on it is that broken pillar.,0,4,0,5,5,,,
01139,Hajime,Trial 4,"We tried to move it, right?",0,4,0,6,6,,,
01140,Hajime,Trial 4,If Nekomaru was crushed by the pillar then there should've been fragments on top of his body.,0,4,0,7,7,,,
01141,Hajime,Trial 4,The pillar fragments were scattered beneath Nekomaru's body but there weren't any on top of his body.,0,4,0,8,8,,,
01142,Hajime,Trial 4,If the pillar had been tipped over and crushed him the fragments should've been on top of his body instead.,0,4,0,9,9,,,
01143,Hajime,Trial 4,U-Ultimate Weapon?,0,4,0,10,10,,,
01144,Hajime,Trial 4,We've seen it?,0,4,0,11,11,,,
01145,Hajime,Trial 4,If we make it out of this I'll explain it to you guys...,0,4,0,12,12,,,
01146,Hajime,Trial 4,"Both of those towers, are they really the same place?",0,4,0,13,13,,,
01147,Hajime,Trial 4,"I mean, doesn't it seem strange?",0,4,0,14,14,,,
01148,Hajime,Trial 4,"When we went to Grape Tower in front of Grape Hall, Nekomaru's body was in front of the door to Strawberry Hall...",0,4,0,15,15,,,
01149,Hajime,Trial 4,...but when we went to Strawberry Tower from Strawberry Hall his body was in front of the door to Grape Hall.,0,4,0,16,16,,,
01150,Hajime,Trial 4,If the floor didn't rotate then that means we need to think of the structure of the building again.,0,4,0,17,17,,,
01151,Hajime,Trial 4,While we were moving from Grape Tower to Strawberry Tower...,0,4,0,18,18,,,
01152,Hajime,Trial 4,But we should've all been together during that time! Even if they tried to move the body inside the tower.,0,4,0,19,19,,,
01153,Hajime,Trial 4,But Nekomaru's body wasn't the only thing moved! Are you saying the broken pillar was moved too?,0,4,0,20,20,,,
01154,Hajime,Trial 4,Moving the body and the pillar in such a short time...,0,4,0,21,21,,,
01155,Hajime,Trial 4,"...that might be hard even for Monokuma, don't you think?",0,4,0,22,22,,,
01156,Hajime,Trial 4,Moving the body and pillar is possible but it would've been impossible to move the oil on the floor.,0,4,0,23,23,,,
01157,Hajime,Trial 4,When the position of Nekomaru's body and the pillar changed the oil surrounding his body moved too.,0,4,0,24,24,,,
01158,Hajime,Trial 4,Physically moving all of the oil like that is simply impossible no matter how you look at it.,0,4,0,25,25,,,
01159,Hajime,Trial 4,...,0,4,0,26,26,,,
01160,Hajime,Trial 4,"Hey, Nagito...",0,4,0,27,27,,,
01161,Hajime,Trial 4,"You're talking about the Final Dead Room, right?",0,4,0,28,28,,,
01162,Hajime,Trial 4,"You cleared the life-threatening game there and found something, didn't you?",0,4,0,29,29,,,
01163,Hajime,Trial 4,"You said this photo was taken from the hidden room inside the Final Dead Room, right?",0,4,0,30,30,,,
01164,Hajime,Trial 4,If that's the case then that means it should've been taken from the first floor of Strawberry House.,0,4,0,31,31,,,
01165,Hajime,Trial 4,"Then, this is definitely strange.",0,4,0,32,32,,,
01166,Hajime,Trial 4,This photo doesn't look like it was taken from the first floor. The angle suggests it was taken from higher up.,0,4,0,33,33,,,
01167,Hajime,Trial 4,If the structure of the Funhouse is what we thought it was...,0,4,0,34,34,,,
01168,Hajime,Trial 4,...Grape House and Strawberry House should link to the tower in the middle.,0,4,0,35,35,,,
01169,Hajime,Trial 4,"Which means, if you're viewing the tower from Strawberry House you should see Grape House behind it.",0,4,0,36,36,,,
01170,Hajime,Trial 4,"But in this photo I don't see anything behind the tower. No shadow, no shape, no Grape House at all!",0,4,0,37,37,,,
01171,Hajime,Trial 4,"You're referring to when you suddenly appeared on the second floor of Grape House, right?",0,4,0,38,38,,,
01172,Hajime,Trial 4,"The top floor, so the third floor?",0,4,0,39,39,,,
01173,Hajime,Trial 4,I got it! I know the secret of the Funhouse!,0,4,0,40,40,,,
01174,Hajime,Trial 4,In the picture Nagito took from Strawberry House I didn't see Grape House at all.,0,4,0,41,41,,,
01175,Hajime,Trial 4,So where did Grape House go?,0,4,0,42,42,,,
01176,Hajime,Trial 4,There is only one possibility. It was in a position where it couldn't be seen from Strawberry House.,0,4,0,43,43,,,
01177,Hajime,Trial 4,"Wich means, Strawberry House and Grape House are in the same building but on different floors.",0,4,0,44,44,,,
01178,Hajime,Trial 4,"If you think about it like that, based on Nagito's picture it's clear where Strawberry House is located.",0,4,0,45,45,,,
01179,Hajime,Trial 4,On top of Grape House! That's where Strawberry House is located.,0,4,0,46,46,,,
01180,Hajime,Trial 4,"Because of that, the photo taken from the first floor of Strawberrry House was at a high angle.",0,4,0,47,47,,,
01181,Hajime,Trial 4,All together this means the first floor of Strawberry House is also the fourth floor above Grape House.,0,4,0,48,48,,,
01182,Hajime,Trial 4,"Yeah, Strawberry Tower and Grape Tower should've also different floors inside the same building.",0,4,0,49,49,,,
01183,Hajime,Trial 4,Just like Strawberry House was on top of Grape House...,0,4,0,50,50,,,
01184,Hajime,Trial 4,...Strawberry Tower was also on top of Grape Tower.,0,4,0,51,51,,,
01185,Hajime,Trial 4,Nekomaru's body wasn't a dummy. That can be proven by Kazuichi's account.,0,4,0,52,52,,,
01186,Hajime,Trial 4,Remember? When we moved from Grape Tower to Strawberry Tower...,0,4,0,53,53,,,
01187,Hajime,Trial 4,...we thought the body had moved. And that's when you said...,0,4,0,54,54,,,
01188,Hajime,Trial 4,"Right up until that moment you were disassembling Nekomaru's body at Grape Tower, right?",0,4,0,55,55,,,
01189,Hajime,Trial 4,The killer couldn't have known how you'd take apart his body so they couldn't have built a dummy.,0,4,0,56,56,,,
01190,Hajime,Trial 4,You... must be talking about an elevator.,0,4,0,57,57,,,
01191,Hajime,Trial 4,It's the tower itself!,0,4,0,58,58,,,
01192,Hajime,Trial 4,The inside of the tower is one big elevator!,0,4,0,59,59,,,
01193,Hajime,Trial 4,Which means the tower was designed so that the whole room goes up and down like an elevator.,0,4,0,60,60,,,
01194,Hajime,Trial 4,So whether you enter from Strawberry Hall or Grape Hall...,0,4,0,61,61,,,
01195,Hajime,Trial 4,"...it all leads to the same room, right?",0,4,0,62,62,,,
01196,Hajime,Trial 4,Is it safe to say that all the items on the floor didn't change?,0,4,0,63,63,,,
01197,Hajime,Trial 4,...and?,0,4,0,64,64,,,
01198,Hajime,Trial 4,So that's it! The elevator was designed so only the floor moved.,0,4,0,65,65,,,
01199,Hajime,Trial 4,"Which means the whole room wasn't an elevator, only the floor was.",0,4,0,66,66,,,
01200,Hajime,Trial 4,That's why we saw different doors in each tower.,0,4,0,67,67,,,
01201,Hajime,Trial 4,Which means on the first floor of Grape Tower the door on the far back wall had a strawberry design.,0,4,0,68,68,,,
01202,Hajime,Trial 4,"...and on the fourth floor, which was Strawberry Tower, the different door on the far back wall had a grape design.",0,4,0,69,69,,,
01203,Hajime,Trial 4,The elevator wasn't just moving vertically.,0,4,0,70,70,,,
01204,Hajime,Trial 4,"Isn't that right, Kazuichi?",0,4,0,71,71,,,
01205,Hajime,Trial 4,"C-come on! You used the elevator while holding that compass Nagito gave you, right?",0,4,0,72,72,,,
01206,Hajime,Trial 4,"And thanks to that, the tower we saw on our right side when we arrived at Grape House...",0,4,0,73,73,,,
01207,Hajime,Trial 4,...appeared on our left side when we were at Strawberry House.,0,4,0,74,74,,,
01208,Hajime,Trial 4,"If I recall, an octagon is a shape with eight sides, right?",0,4,0,75,75,,,
01209,Hajime,Trial 4,...,0,4,0,76,76,,,
01210,Hajime,Trial 4,You're talking about the secret room surrounded by concrete in the depths of the Final Dead Room.,0,4,0,77,77,,,
01211,Hajime,Trial 4,Learned?,0,4,0,78,78,,,
01212,Hajime,Trial 4,...,0,4,0,79,79,,,
01213,Hajime,Trial 4,...how they killed Nekomaru.,0,4,0,80,80,,,
01214,Hajime,Trial 4,That's it! I think he might've died from falling!,0,4,0,81,81,,,
01215,Hajime,Trial 4,If the Funhouse's secret is that it's a structure where both towers and houses are vertically connected...,0,4,0,82,82,,,
01216,Hajime,Trial 4,...then the killer made use of its height and caused Nekomaru to die from falling.,0,4,0,83,83,,,
01217,Hajime,Trial 4,That I don't know yet.,0,4,0,84,84,,,
01218,Hajime,Trial 4,That sensor should only work if something is moving.,0,4,0,85,85,,,
01219,Hajime,Trial 4,If Nekomaru wasn't moving inside the elevator sensor wouldn't have detected anything.,0,4,0,86,86,,,
01220,Hajime,Trial 4,When Nekomaru's good night button is pressed all of his functions shut down and he enters sleep mode.,0,4,0,87,87,,,
01221,Hajime,Trial 4,"If he's in sleep mode the elevator sensor wouldn't have noticed him, right?",0,4,0,88,88,,,
01222,Hajime,Trial 4,Didn't the door knob have scrape marks on it?,0,4,0,89,89,,,
01223,Hajime,Trial 4,That might've been where it got scraped by the wire.,0,4,0,90,90,,,
01224,Hajime,Trial 4,The tip of that wire was tied into a loop.,0,4,0,91,91,,,
01225,Hajime,Trial 4,If the elevator moved while that loop part hung from the doorknob...,0,4,0,92,92,,,
01226,Hajime,Trial 4,The killer took advantage of the elevator's unique feature: Only the floor moved.,0,4,0,93,93,,,
01227,Hajime,Trial 4,By doing that they created a drop so Nekomaru could fall to his death.,0,4,0,94,94,,,
01228,Hajime,Trial 4,Why?,0,4,0,95,95,,,
01229,Hajime,Trial 4,It doesn't mean someone had to push him off.,0,4,0,96,96,,,
01230,Hajime,Trial 4,It's possible that he fell on his own!,0,4,0,97,97,,,
01231,Hajime,Trial 4,What do you think would happen if Nekomaru woke up while he was suspended upside down in midair?,0,4,0,98,98,,,
01232,Hajime,Trial 4,He has an alarm inside his body. As long as it was armed it would've deactivated his sleep mode.,0,4,0,99,99,,,
01233,Hajime,Trial 4,...which means the killer set the alarm before they suspended Nekomaru.,0,4,0,100,100,,,
01234,Hajime,Trial 4,He fell because the entire door knob came off.,0,4,0,101,101,,,
01235,Hajime,Trial 4,Do you finally understand now?,0,4,0,102,102,,,
01236,Hajime,Trial 4,"When Nekomaru fell to the floor he ended up colliding with the pillar, isn't that it?",0,4,0,103,103,,,
01237,Hajime,Trial 4,"No, the clock inside his chest was a radio clock so it would've been impossible to mess with.",0,4,0,104,104,,,
01238,Hajime,Trial 4,...,0,4,0,105,105,,,
01239,Hajime,Trial 4,"You said you checked all the clocks inside the building, isn't that right Fuyuhiko?",0,4,0,106,106,,,
01240,Hajime,Trial 4,But what if all those clocks had been messed with?,0,4,0,107,107,,,
01241,Hajime,Trial 4,So even if you checked all the clocks inside the building there's no way you would've noticed it.,0,4,0,108,108,,,
01242,Hajime,Trial 4,"That's right, we should've heard the sound he made when he fell. Wasn't it that rumbling noise?",0,4,0,109,109,,,
01243,Hajime,Trial 4,"Well, a huge body fell from the fourth floor to the first. And the pillar fell with it.",0,4,0,110,110,,,
01244,Hajime,Trial 4,It's obvious we'd hear the impact sound.,0,4,0,111,111,,,
01245,Hajime,Trial 4,Huh?,0,4,0,112,112,,,
01246,Hajime,Trial 4,Nekomaru's alarm went off at 7:30 and if we heard the sound of his impact at 5:30...,0,4,0,113,113,,,
01247,Hajime,Trial 4,...that means our time was off by two hours!,0,4,0,114,114,,,
01248,Hajime,Trial 4,That's it! The killer made use of the Monokuma Tai Chi activity in the morning.,0,4,0,115,115,,,
01249,Hajime,Trial 4,We wouldn't be able to attend on time but that wouldn't affect Nekomaru.,0,4,0,116,116,,,
01250,Hajime,Trial 4,His radio clock had the exact time.,0,4,0,117,117,,,
01251,Hajime,Trial 4,I see... Now that I think about it I realize what Monokuma meant when he said those words.,0,4,0,118,118,,,
01252,Hajime,Trial 4,"When you said ""everyone"" you were including us, right?",0,4,0,119,119,,,
01253,Hajime,Trial 4,We thought we came to the tower on time but in truth it was way past the meeting time.,0,4,0,120,120,,,
01254,Hajime,Trial 4,"The one who wasn't there... It's you, right Nagito?",0,4,0,121,121,,,
01255,Hajime,Trial 4,You couldn't? What do you mean?,0,4,0,122,122,,,
01256,Hajime,Trial 4,"Nagito, Sonia and Chiaki. The three of you were staying in Deluxe Rooms, right?",0,4,0,123,123,,,
01257,Hajime,Trial 4,"If I recall, the Deluxe Rooms are...",0,4,0,124,124,,,
01258,Hajime,Trial 4,...,0,4,0,125,125,,,
01259,Hajime,Trial 4,"Gundham, there's something I wanna ask you.",0,4,0,126,126,,,
01260,Hajime,Trial 4,"When the alarm rang at the Strawberry Houes lounge you rushed over there too, right?",0,4,0,127,127,,,
01261,Hajime,Trial 4,Why were you able to hear it?,0,4,0,128,128,,,
01262,Hajime,Trial 4,"I mean, you were also staying in a Deluxe Room, right?",0,4,0,129,129,,,
01263,Hajime,Trial 4,Nagito was staying in a Deluxe Room in the same house on the same floor and he couldn't even hear it.,0,4,0,130,130,,,
01264,Hajime,Trial 4,So why were you able to hear that alarm?,0,4,0,131,131,,,
01265,Hajime,Trial 4,There's only one possibility: You weren't in your room at the time.,0,4,0,132,132,,,
01266,Hajime,Trial 4,"That's why, even though you were staying in a Deluxe Room, you still went to the lounge. Am I right?",0,4,0,133,133,,,
01267,Hajime,Trial 4,"In order to do that, the killer needed to be waiting for Nekomaru at the tower.",0,4,0,134,134,,,
01268,Hajime,Trial 4,Which means when Fuyuhiko witnessed Nekomaru the killer was already at the tower.,0,4,0,135,135,,,
01269,Hajime,Trial 4,Is that... your argument?,0,4,0,136,136,,,
01270,Hajime,Trial 4,H-hold on a sec!,0,4,0,137,137,,,
01271,Hajime,Trial 4,"Nagito... Something definitely happened to you, didn't it?",0,4,0,138,138,,,
01272,Hajime,Trial 4,At some point during the investigation your behaviour became even weirder.,0,4,0,139,139,,,
01273,Hajime,Trial 4,What? What actually happened? Did you discover something?,0,4,0,140,140,,,
01274,Hajime,Trial 4,Since the beginning?,0,4,0,141,141,,,
01275,Hajime,Trial 4,No! There should've been another way to move between the two houses without the elevator.,0,4,0,142,142,,,
01276,Hajime,Trial 4,Then why don't we ask the person who actually used that method?,0,4,0,143,143,,,
01277,Hajime,Trial 4,"Nagito, you should know.",0,4,0,144,144,,,
01278,Hajime,Trial 4,"Don't play dumb, you appeared so suddenly that one time because you used that method, right?",0,4,0,145,145,,,
01279,Hajime,Trial 4,There's a secret passage connecting the First floor of Strawberry House to the third floor of Grape House.,0,4,0,146,146,,,
01280,Hajime,Trial 4,Isn't that right?,0,4,0,147,147,,,
01281,Hajime,Trial 4,If they used that secret passage they could've gone between the two houses as much as they wanted.,0,4,0,148,148,,,
01282,Hajime,Trial 4,There's no way they didn't know.,0,4,0,149,149,,,
01283,Hajime,Trial 4,There's no way I can stop!,0,4,0,150,150,,,
01284,Hajime,Trial 4,I already proved a secret passage exists!,0,4,0,151,151,,,
01285,Hajime,Trial 4,The secret passage was at the Octagon.,0,4,0,152,152,,,
01286,Hajime,Trial 4,The wire used to string up Nekomaru's body...,0,4,0,153,153,,,
01287,Hajime,Trial 4,...the hammer that looked like the weapon and the chain on the door in the tower...,0,4,0,154,154,,,
01288,Hajime,Trial 4,...those were all the items that weren't in the Funhouse. Where did the killer obtain them?,0,4,0,155,155,,,
01289,Hajime,Trial 4,Since those items were used in the crime there's no doubt that the killer went to the Octagon!,0,4,0,156,156,,,
01290,Hajime,Trial 4,H-hey! What are you-?,0,4,0,157,157,,,
01291,Hajime,Trial 4,W-what do you intend to do?,0,4,0,158,158,,,
01292,Hajime,Trial 4,Are you saying you still have more? You still have room to argue?,0,4,0,159,159,,,
01293,Hajime,Trial 4,...,0,4,0,160,160,,,
01294,Hajime,Trial 4,"That's wrong, Gundham.",0,4,0,161,161,,,
01295,Hajime,Trial 4,You're the one who's wrong!,0,4,0,162,162,,,
01296,Hajime,Trial 4,Even if you didn't get behind Nekomaru you should've been able to press the button on the back of his neck.,0,4,0,163,163,,,
01297,Hajime,Trial 4,As long as you have the powers of the hamsters you keep with you!,0,4,0,164,164,,,
01298,Hajime,Trial 4,Of course that'd be impossible for a normal hamster but it would've been possible for Gundham's.,0,4,0,165,165,,,
01299,Hajime,Trial 4,"In fact, we saw that with our very own eyes, right?",0,4,0,166,166,,,
01300,Hajime,Trial 4,"How about it, Gundham?",0,4,0,167,167,,,
01301,Hajime,CR 4,Let's first go over the many tricks the killer prepared before they committed their crime.,0,4,0,168,168,,,
01302,Hajime,CR 4,"First, they destroyed the contact elevator.",0,4,0,169,169,,,
01303,Hajime,CR 4,This separated Nagito and the others in Strawberry House from our group in Grape House.,0,4,0,170,170,,,
01304,Hajime,CR 4,"Next, they lured Nekomaru out by himself by turning back all the clocks in the Funhouse by two hours.",0,4,0,171,171,,,
01305,Hajime,CR 4,"Additionally, in order to secure an alibi, the killer went to the Strawberry House lounge...",0,4,0,172,172,,,
01306,Hajime,CR 4,...and set the wall clock's alarm to 5:30 AM.,0,4,0,173,173,,,
01307,Hajime,CR 4,After finishing their preparations the killer went to Strawberry Tower with the necessary tools in hand.,0,4,0,174,174,,,
01308,Hajime,CR 4,They obtained these tools from the Octagon which you can enter once you clear the Final Dead Room.,0,4,0,175,175,,,
01309,Hajime,CR 4,"This means, the killer discovered the secret of the Funhouse faster than anybody else.",0,4,0,176,176,,,
01310,Hajime,CR 4,"That secret being, Strawberry House and Grape House are actually the same building!",0,4,0,177,177,,,
01311,Hajime,CR 4,"On the morning of the incident, Nekomaru woke up and headed over to Grape Tower for a specific reason.",0,4,0,178,178,,,
01312,Hajime,CR 4,"There, Fuyuhiko who was at the lounge by coincidence witnessed Nekomaru.",0,4,0,179,179,,,
01313,Hajime,CR 4,According to Fuyuhiko's testimony that was around 5 AM but...,0,4,0,180,180,,,
01314,Hajime,CR 4,"...by that point, the killer had already messed with our perception of time.",0,4,0,181,181,,,
01315,Hajime,CR 4,"In actuality, Fuyuhiko witnessed Nekomaru at 7 AM.",0,4,0,182,182,,,
01316,Hajime,CR 4,That's also the same time Monokuma Tai Chi begins. Nekomaru went to Grape Tower to participate in that.,0,4,0,183,183,,,
01317,Hajime,CR 4,"However, because the contact elevator was broken, Nekomaru was unable to go to Grape Tower.",0,4,0,184,184,,,
01318,Hajime,CR 4,So he decided to try going to Strawberry Tower.,0,4,0,185,185,,,
01319,Hajime,CR 4,"But, the killer was waiting for him there.",0,4,0,186,186,,,
01320,Hajime,CR 4,With the power of hamsters they were able to press the good night button at the back of Nekomaru's head.,0,4,0,187,187,,,
01321,Hajime,CR 4,"This forced him to enter sleep mode, rendering him immobile.",0,4,0,188,188,,,
01322,Hajime,CR 4,"From there, the killer began preparing to use the Ultimate Weapon.",0,4,0,189,189,,,
01323,Hajime,CR 4,"First, they set the alarm in Nekomaru's chest to 7:30 AM so he'd wake up.",0,4,0,190,190,,,
01324,Hajime,CR 4,"Then they tied him up with the metal wire, tied the tip of the wire into a loop and hung it on the door knob.",0,4,0,191,191,,,
01325,Hajime,CR 4,After leaving Strawberry Tower the killer then destroyed the door button to Strawberry Hall.,0,4,0,192,192,,,
01326,Hajime,CR 4,They did this to keep us from entering Strawberry Tower.,0,4,0,193,193,,,
01327,Hajime,CR 4,And to keep us from discovering the secret of the building's structure that they used to kill Nekomaru.,0,4,0,194,194,,,
01328,Hajime,CR 4,"Then, they used the secrate Octagon passageway to travel to Grape House.",0,4,0,195,195,,,
01329,Hajime,CR 4,After arriving at Grape Hall they pressed the button to open the door to the tower.,0,4,0,196,196,,,
01330,Hajime,CR 4,"When that happened, the elevator-like floor of the tower began descending.",0,4,0,197,197,,,
01331,Hajime,CR 4,"And Nekomaru's body was still inside, dangling upside down in midair from the wire.",0,4,0,198,198,,,
01332,Hajime,CR 4,The killer entered Grape Tower to see if their set-up was successful...,0,4,0,199,199,,,
01333,Hajime,CR 4,"...and placed a hammer on the floor to look like the weapon, then wrapped a chain around the back door.",0,4,0,200,200,,,
01334,Hajime,CR 4,This was done to make us falsely believe we couldn't enter the tower from Strawberry Hall.,0,4,0,201,201,,,
01335,Hajime,CR 4,"With this, the killer finished their setup and tried to go back to their room using the secret passage...",0,4,0,202,202,,,
01336,Hajime,CR 4,...so they could craft their alibi when Nekomaru died from the fall.,0,4,0,203,203,,,
01337,Hajime,CR 4,"But, something unexpected happened. Fuyuhiko who saw Nekomaru earlier was still at the lounge.",0,4,0,204,204,,,
01338,Hajime,CR 4,"As a result, the killer couldn't return to their room and with no options available, time ran out.",0,4,0,205,205,,,
01339,Hajime,CR 4,"The lounge's wall clock alarm started ringing at 5:30, well, actually 7:30.",0,4,0,206,206,,,
01340,Hajime,CR 4,To avoid a worst case scenario the killer was forced to appear in front of Fuyuhiko and the others.,0,4,0,207,207,,,
01341,Hajime,CR 4,When the wall clock's alarm rang that was also the same time Nekomaru was waking up.,0,4,0,208,208,,,
01342,Hajime,CR 4,He woke up while he was still hanging upside down so he couldn't help but sway his body powerfully.,0,4,0,209,209,,,
01343,Hajime,CR 4,"Originally, the loop of wire was only supposed to slip off the door knob...",0,4,0,210,210,,,
01344,Hajime,CR 4,...but because there was a heavier load than expected the door knob ended up breaking.,0,4,0,211,211,,,
01345,Hajime,CR 4,Nekomaru fell from the fourth floor all the way to the first floor.,0,4,0,212,212,,,
01346,Hajime,CR 4,"He crashed into the pillar which decapitated him on impact, and died",0,4,0,213,213,,,
01347,Hajime,CR 4,The sound of Nekomaru's impact echoed throughout the Funhouse.,0,4,0,214,214,,,
01348,Hajime,CR 4,I didn't know where the name came from at the time but the killer should've known.,0,4,0,215,215,,,
01349,Hajime,CR 4,They should've known their Ultimate Weapon trick had succeeded and that Nekomaru had died.,0,4,0,216,216,,,
01350,Hajime,CR 4,"However, by this point the killer's plan was about to fail thanks to the broken door knob and Fuyuhiko.",0,4,0,217,217,,,
01351,Hajime,CR 4,"Meaning, the killer is someone who wouldn't have heard the alarm if they were in the Deluxe Room.",0,4,0,218,218,,,
01352,Hajime,CR 4,They also wouldn't have been able to return to their guest room because Fuyuhiko was at the lounge.,0,4,0,219,219,,,
01353,Hajime,CR 4,That someone is Gundham Tanaka! I can't think of anyone else but you!,0,4,0,220,220,,,
01354,Hajime,Trial 5,But Nagito's mouth was covered with duct tape so he wouldn't have been able to confess anything.,0,5,0,1,1,,,
01355,Hajime,Trial 5,If he was being tortured for information they wouldn't have taped his mouth like that.,0,5,0,2,2,,,
01356,Hajime,Trial 5,Trap?,0,5,0,3,3,,,
01357,Hajime,Trial 5,But if you tape his mouth shut...,0,5,0,4,4,,,
01358,Hajime,Trial 5,...how is he supposed to answer anything?,0,5,0,5,5,,,
01359,Hajime,Trial 5,"No, there's no doubt Nagito's mouth was covered with duct tape before he was beat up.",0,5,0,6,6,,,
01360,Hajime,Trial 5,The blood on his face came from his arm wounds...,0,5,0,7,7,,,
01361,Hajime,Trial 5,...which means the duct tape was on his face before his arms were even wounded.,0,5,0,8,8,,,
01362,Hajime,Trial 5,I also agree that opening the door is what started the fire.,0,5,0,9,9,,,
01363,Hajime,Trial 5,"No, not wind pressure. They probably used the Monokuma panels.",0,5,0,10,10,,,
01364,Hajime,Trial 5,"A huge number of tipped over Monokuma panels were found at the crime scene, right?",0,5,0,11,11,,,
01365,Hajime,Trial 5,It looked like they were scattered everywhere but some where laying on top of each other in a single line.,0,5,0,12,12,,,
01366,Hajime,Trial 5,Just a single line leading from the warehouse door to the fire's origin.,0,5,0,13,13,,,
01367,Hajime,Trial 5,The killer probably arranged those monokuma panels to create a domino effect.,0,5,0,14,14,,,
01368,Hajime,Trial 5,That's probably why they turned off the lights in the warehouse so we wouldn't notice them.,0,5,0,15,15,,,
01369,Hajime,Trial 5,"You're talking about the MP3-player, right?",0,5,0,16,16,,,
01370,Hajime,Trial 5,That hymn blaring throughout the warehouse masked the sound of the falling panels.,0,5,0,17,17,,,
01371,Hajime,Trial 5,If the panel was so close to the door that it could barely be opened...,0,5,0,18,18,,,
01372,Hajime,Trial 5,"...the killer inside the warehouse wouldn't be able to leave, right?",0,5,0,19,19,,,
01373,Hajime,Trial 5,You don't mean-!,0,5,0,20,20,,,
01374,Hajime,Trial 5,...,0,5,0,21,21,,,
01375,Hajime,Trial 5,What if it was Nagito?,0,5,0,22,22,,,
01376,Hajime,Trial 5,Hold on a sec. Isn't that premise flawed?,0,5,0,23,23,,,
01377,Hajime,Trial 5,"No, it shouldn't have been both of his arms.",0,5,0,24,24,,,
01378,Hajime,Trial 5,"The rope on his right arm was completely burned up. Based on that, you can't say he was tied up.",0,5,0,25,25,,,
01379,Hajime,Trial 5,"It burned because of the fire, like you said it might look like that.",0,5,0,26,26,,,
01380,Hajime,Trial 5,But that was part of the trap! There's concrete evidence that proves that.,0,5,0,27,27,,,
01381,Hajime,Trial 5,Take a close look at his right sleeve.,0,5,0,28,28,,,
01382,Hajime,Trial 5,"Even though the rope was burned up his sleeve wasn't burned at all, wouldn't you agree?",0,5,0,29,29,,,
01383,Hajime,Trial 5,"A burn like this, no matter how you think about it, is unnatural.",0,5,0,30,30,,,
01384,Hajime,Trial 5,That rope was burned in advance so it would look like it was burned in the fire.,0,5,0,31,31,,,
01385,Hajime,Trial 5,"Yeah, that should be the case.",0,5,0,32,32,,,
01386,Hajime,Trial 5,H-hold on! There should be a way.,0,5,0,33,33,,,
01387,Hajime,Trial 5,The life-sized Monokuma plushie! He must've used that to prop the knife!,0,5,0,34,34,,,
01388,Hajime,Trial 5,So the blood on the plushie came from Nagito after he stabbed the knife into his own right hand.,0,5,0,35,35,,,
01389,Hajime,Trial 5,"Alright, let's do this!",0,5,0,36,36,,,
01390,Hajime,Trial 5,"Hold on, it's still too early to dismiss the possibility that he used his left hand.",0,5,0,37,37,,,
01391,Hajime,Trial 5,But there was something off about his left hand...,0,5,0,38,38,,,
01392,Hajime,Trial 5,The bloodstain on the palm of his hand... Don't you think it looked somewhat strange?,0,5,0,39,39,,,
01393,Hajime,Trial 5,"He only had blood on the lower area of his arm. Beyond that point the bloodstain suddenly cuts off, right?",0,5,0,40,40,,,
01394,Hajime,Trial 5,When the blood splattered he was probably gripping with his left hand.,0,5,0,41,41,,,
01395,Hajime,Trial 5,That's why there's such a strange looking bloodstain on his palm and the back of his hand.,0,5,0,42,42,,,
01396,Hajime,Trial 5,"Hey Chiaki, what do you think?",0,5,0,43,43,,,
01397,Hajime,Trial 5,"Hey, don't tell me you're getting sleepy!",0,5,0,44,44,,,
01398,Hajime,Trial 5,That's it! Instead of the handle Nagito must've been holding onto the cord.,0,5,0,45,45,,,
01399,Hajime,Trial 5,"There was a metal weight at the tip of the cord but there were bloodstains on that part, too.",0,5,0,46,46,,,
01400,Hajime,Trial 5,"Plus, the joint between the weight and the cord had a bloodstain shaped like it was cut off by something.",0,5,0,47,47,,,
01401,Hajime,Trial 5,...,0,5,0,48,48,,,
01402,Hajime,Trial 5,How it was positioned...,0,5,0,49,49,,,
01403,Hajime,Trial 5,The spear impaled Nagito as he was lying face up. It must have been perpendicular to him just before that.,0,5,0,50,50,,,
01404,Hajime,Trial 5,Nagito probably slung the cord over the ceiling girder and using that as a support...,0,5,0,51,51,,,
01405,Hajime,Trial 5,...he hoisted the spear directly above him.,0,5,0,52,52,,,
01406,Hajime,Trial 5,And if Nagito let go of the cord the spear would've fallen and impaled him while he was laying face up.,0,5,0,53,53,,,
01407,Hajime,Trial 5,The blood on the cord probably rubbed off on the ceiling girder as the spear was falling.,0,5,0,54,54,,,
01408,Hajime,Trial 5,"So, how about it? Using this method, Nagito could've impaled himself with the spear.",0,5,0,55,55,,,
01409,Hajime,Trial 5,I agree. When I was investigating this case I kept thinking over and over how strange it was.,0,5,0,56,56,,,
01410,Hajime,Trial 5,Why did the killer use the knife and the spear so differently?,0,5,0,57,57,,,
01411,Hajime,Trial 5,He was probably trying to get us to make a mistake.,0,5,0,58,58,,,
01412,Hajime,Trial 5,"By committing a suicide that looked like a murder, he was trying to steer us toward the wrong answer!",0,5,0,59,59,,,
01413,Hajime,Trial 5,His goal was to get us all executed!,0,5,0,60,60,,,

01419,Hajime,Trial 5,I can't help but feel like there's still something we overlooked.,0,5,0,66,66,,,
01420,Hajime,Trial 5,That's true but...,0,5,0,67,67,,,
01421,Hajime,Trial 5,Is it about the Monokuma File?,0,5,0,68,68,,,
01422,Hajime,Trial 5,In this particular case's Monokuma File there's no specific cause of death.,0,5,0,69,69,,,

01425,Hajime,Trial 5,...,0,5,0,72,72,,,
01426,Hajime,Trial 5,Come to think of it...,0,5,0,73,73,,,
01427,Hajime,Trial 5,"...did Nagito really, really commit suicide just to get us all killed?",0,5,0,74,74,,,
01428,Hajime,Trial 5,Th-that's not what I meant. I mean it in a bad sense.,0,5,0,75,75,,,
01429,Hajime,Trial 5,I just remembered that his malice always defied our expectations. And that concerns me.,0,5,0,76,76,,,
01430,Hajime,Trial 5,"For example, with that malice just in here...",0,5,0,77,77,,,
01431,Hajime,Trial 5,Did Nagito's malice drive him to risk his life for a truth we'd reach this easily?,0,5,0,78,78,,,

01434,Hajime,Trial 5,...,0,5,0,81,81,,,
01435,Hajime,Trial 5,"That was definitely a gruesome wound but it wouldn't be the fatal wound, don't you think?",0,5,0,82,82,,,
01436,Hajime,Trial 5,"That's it, I totally forgot about that possibility.",0,5,0,83,83,,,
01437,Hajime,Trial 5,If the cause of death was something we can't see then we have to consider poison as a possible method.,0,5,0,84,84,,,
01438,Hajime,Trial 5,"I remember, when I went to investigate Nagito's cottage I discovered something really strange.",0,5,0,85,85,,,
01439,Hajime,Trial 5,Inside the refrigerator I found a bottle of Monokuma's special poison.,0,5,0,86,86,,,
01440,Hajime,Trial 5,"No, the warning label on the bottle explicitly states the effect is instant.",0,5,0,87,87,,,
01441,Hajime,Trial 5,Are there any left?,0,5,0,88,88,,,
01442,Hajime,Trial 5,What if instead of drinking the poison we assume he inhaled it?,0,5,0,89,89,,,
01443,Hajime,Trial 5,It's written on the poison's warning label.,0,5,0,90,90,,,
01444,Hajime,Trial 5,"""Dangerous when vaporized."" In other words, breathing in the gas is fatal.",0,5,0,91,91,,,
01445,Hajime,Trial 5,The sprinklers in the warehouse! Thanks to those we didn't inhale that poison gas.,0,5,0,92,92,,,
01446,Hajime,Trial 5,"Yeah, the true cause of Nagito's death was poisoning!",0,5,0,93,93,,,

01448,Hajime,Trial 5,Huh?,0,5,0,95,95,,,
01449,Hajime,Trial 5,W-well... But-!,0,5,0,96,96,,,
01450,Hajime,Trial 5,Are you talking about the container the poison was kept in?,0,5,0,97,97,,,
01451,Hajime,Trial 5,"Yeah, that was written on the warning label...",0,5,0,98,98,,,
01452,Hajime,Trial 5,"Then, does that mean someone got rid off the container?",0,5,0,99,99,,,
01453,Hajime,Trial 5,...,0,5,0,100,100,,,
01454,Hajime,Trial 5,That's no good!,0,5,0,101,101,,,
01455,Hajime,Trial 5,I feel like Nagito is seeing through us!,0,5,0,102,102,,,
01456,Hajime,Trial 5,"By calling this ""Nagito's suicide"" we're trying to take the easy way out so we don't hurt anyone else.",0,5,0,103,103,,,
01457,Hajime,Trial 5,But if Nagito was here right now he'd probably be sneering at us.,0,5,0,104,104,,,

01460,Hajime,Trial 5,Ah-!,0,5,0,107,107,,,
01461,Hajime,Trial 5,...,0,5,0,108,108,,,
01462,Hajime,Trial 5,I see! I got it!,0,5,0,109,109,,,
01463,Hajime,Trial 5,The fire grenades!,0,5,0,110,110,,,
01464,Hajime,Trial 5,Nagito put the fire inside one of the fire grenade canisters and transported it to the warehouse.,0,5,0,111,111,,,
01465,Hajime,Trial 5,"Yeah, the container with the poison in it wasn't secretely taken away by someone.",0,5,0,112,112,,,
01466,Hajime,Trial 5,"Instead, it was in a container that didn't need to be taken away in the first place.",0,5,0,113,113,,,
01467,Hajime,Trial 5,As long as he put the poison in the same container he brought to the warehouse...,0,5,0,114,114,,,
01468,Hajime,Trial 5,"...it can be hidden with the other fire grenades we used, so there's no need to dispose of the container later.",0,5,0,115,115,,,
01469,Hajime,Trial 5,"Yeah, that has to be it!",0,5,0,116,116,,,
01470,Hajime,Trial 5,Hold on! Did you say aluminum?,0,5,0,117,117,,,
01471,Hajime,Trial 5,If so then there's no mistake! Nagito definitely swapped the contents of one of the fire grenades.,0,5,0,118,118,,,
01472,Hajime,Trial 5,"Take a look, we found this under Nagito's bed when we were investigating his cottage.",0,5,0,119,119,,,

01475,Hajime,Trial 5,Realized what?,0,5,0,122,122,,,
01476,Hajime,Trial 5,The... horrifying truth?,0,5,0,123,123,,,
01477,Hajime,Trial 5,Are you saying... it was when we all threw the fire grenades?,0,5,0,124,124,,,
01478,Hajime,Trial 5,One of us...,0,5,0,125,125,,,
01479,Hajime,Trial 5,Do you know?,0,5,0,126,126,,,
01480,Hajime,Trial 5,"It was Nagito, obviously. We just discussed this a few minutes ago.",0,5,0,127,127,,,
01481,Hajime,Trial 5,That was also Nagito.,0,5,0,128,128,,,
01482,Hajime,Trial 5,"Don't tell me, he...",0,5,0,129,129,,,
01483,Hajime,Trial 5,He set the warehouse on fire just so we'd have to throw the fire grenades?,0,5,0,130,130,,,
01484,Hajime,Trial 5,This wasn't an intentional murder! This was a murder that Nagito forced someone to do.,0,5,0,131,131,,,
01485,Hajime,Trial 5,And for that reason...,0,5,0,132,132,,,
01486,Hajime,Trial 5,...he put the fire grenade that he filled with poison with the other grenades...,0,5,0,133,133,,,
01487,Hajime,Trial 5,...setting up a murder nobody can solve! That was Nagito's true goal!,0,5,0,134,134,,,
01488,Hajime,Trial 5,That was his trap all along!,0,5,0,135,135,,,
01489,Hajime,Trial 5,"Even the wounds all over his body, it was to mess with the evidence for what actually happened!",0,5,0,136,136,,,
01490,Hajime,Trial 5,His true goal was creating a murder that nobody can solve!,0,5,0,137,137,,,
01491,Hajime,Trial 5,He wanted to prove to us that there are mysteries that just can't be solved with educated guesses.,0,5,0,138,138,,,
01492,Hajime,Trial 5,It's impossible!,0,5,0,139,139,,,
01493,Hajime,Trial 5,Nagito wanted to create a scenario where we couldn't make a decision. That's why we're at an impasse.,0,5,0,140,140,,,
01494,Hajime,Trial 5,Is there any way to figure out who the killer is?,0,5,0,141,141,,,
01495,Hajime,Trial 5,...,0,5,0,142,142,,,
01496,Hajime,Trial 5,I got it! Let's do this then!,0,5,0,143,143,,,
01497,Hajime,CR 5,"The person who actually arranged this incident was... the victim, Nagito Komaeda.",0,5,0,144,144,,,
01498,Hajime,CR 5,He kept a specific item inside his cottage that he needed for his plan.,0,5,0,145,145,,,
01499,Hajime,CR 5,Monokum's special poison which he brought with him from the Octagon.,0,5,0,146,146,,,
01500,Hajime,CR 5,Using the gloves and gas mask that he got from the military base...,0,5,0,147,147,,,
01501,Hajime,CR 5,...Nagito swapped the contents of a fire grenade he took from the plushie factory break room with that poison.,0,5,0,148,148,,,
01502,Hajime,CR 5,"When he did that, a specific item was left as evidence: The blue aluminum seal on the grenade.",0,5,0,149,149,,,
01503,Hajime,CR 5,"With that, Nagito finished making the poison fire grenade, took it with him to the factory...",0,5,0,150,150,,,
01504,Hajime,CR 5,...and put it back with the rest of the grenades in the break room.,0,5,0,151,151,,,
01505,Hajime,CR 5,"The next morning, Nagito appeared before us and declared that he hid a bomb somewhere.",0,5,0,152,152,,,
01506,Hajime,CR 5,"While we were looking for the bomb, that's when Nagito headed over to the goods warehouse.",0,5,0,153,153,,,
01507,Hajime,CR 5,"In order to set up a fire, Nagito arranged the Monokuma panels in a line going from the door...",0,5,0,154,154,,,
01508,Hajime,CR 5,"...to the curtain, and placed an oil lighter in front of it.",0,5,0,155,155,,,
01509,Hajime,CR 5,"From there, Nagito set his insane plane in motion.",0,5,0,156,156,,,
01510,Hajime,CR 5,"First, he hung the spear that he took from Nezumi Castle from the ceiling girder by its cord.",0,5,0,157,157,,,
01511,Hajime,CR 5,Then he tied his arms and legs at the back of the warehouse with rope.,0,5,0,158,158,,,
01512,Hajime,CR 5,"However, he burned off the rope on his right arm beforehand.",0,5,0,159,159,,,
01513,Hajime,CR 5,"In doing so, he made sure that only his right hand was free while his remaining arm and legs were tied up.",0,5,0,160,160,,,
01514,Hajime,CR 5,As he gripped the tip of the rope hanging over the ceiling girder with his left hand...,0,5,0,161,161,,,
01515,Hajime,CR 5,"...he laid down face up, just beneath the dangling spear.",0,5,0,162,162,,,
01516,Hajime,CR 5,"But this was just the beginning of Nagito's plan, and then he did something that no one could've predicted.",0,5,0,163,163,,,
01517,Hajime,CR 5,"First, he covered his mouth with duct tape and after making sure that he was unable to scream...",0,5,0,164,164,,,
01518,Hajime,CR 5,...he stabbed himself with the knife he sabbed himself multiple times in his left arm and in both of his thighs.,0,5,0,165,165,,,
01519,Hajime,CR 5,Finally...,0,5,0,166,166,,,
01520,Hajime,CR 5,...he propped the knife on the plushie and slammed his right hand onto the blade.,0,5,0,167,167,,,
01521,Hajime,CR 5,"He didn't just want us to think he was tied up, he also wanted us to think he'd been tortured.",0,5,0,168,168,,,
01522,Hajime,CR 5,"Through all this, Nagito never let go of the spear.",0,5,0,169,169,,,
01523,Hajime,CR 5,"His plan still wasn't over. In fact, it was just about to begin.",0,5,0,170,170,,,
01524,Hajime,CR 5,"Meanwhile, we finally arrived at the plushie factory and found Nagito's message.",0,5,0,171,171,,,
01525,Hajime,CR 5,"After seeing his message, we instantly made our way to the warehouse.",0,5,0,172,172,,,
01526,Hajime,CR 5,But that was part of Nagito's plan!,0,5,0,173,173,,,
01527,Hajime,CR 5,We opened the door to the warehouse which inadvertently started the Monokuma panel domino effect.,0,5,0,174,174,,,
01528,Hajime,CR 5,"The panels fell one after another until they reached the lighter, tipped it over and ignited the curtain.",0,5,0,175,175,,,
01529,Hajime,CR 5,"Shocked by the sudden fire, we rushed to the factory's break room to obtain some fire extinguishing grenades.",0,5,0,176,176,,,
01530,Hajime,CR 5,"We then aimed for the fire's origin point, which was the curtain, and unloaded the entire supply.",0,5,0,177,177,,,
01531,Hajime,CR 5,It never occurred to us that one of the grenades was the poison grenade that Nagito had prepared.,0,5,0,178,178,,,
01532,Hajime,CR 5,"The poison sank to the floor, instantly vaporizing due to the intense heat, and spread everywhere.",0,5,0,179,179,,,
01533,Hajime,CR 5,The poison gas quickly drifted to curtain at the back of the warehouse where Nagito was.,0,5,0,180,180,,,
01534,Hajime,CR 5,"Also, Monokuma's poison has a unique quality in which it becomes heavier than air when vaporized.",0,5,0,181,181,,,
01535,Hajime,CR 5,That poison gas completely surrounded the area where Nagito laid face up on the floor.,0,5,0,182,182,,,
01536,Hajime,CR 5,"There, Nagito inhaled the poison, and if it didn't instanly kill him he certainly lost consciousness...",0,5,0,183,183,,,
01537,Hajime,CR 5,...which caused him to let go of the rope in his left hand and the falling spear plunged into his stomach.,0,5,0,184,184,,,
01538,Hajime,CR 5,This is all the information related to Nagito's plan.,0,5,0,185,185,,,
01539,Hajime,CR 5,His true intention was to set one of us up as the killer.,0,5,0,186,186,,,
01540,Hajime,CR 5,"At this point, we still don't know who the kiler is because the killer wasn't aware they killed someone.",0,5,0,187,187,,,
01541,Hajime,CR 5,"Try as we might, we cannot reach that truth. That was Nagito's trap.",0,5,0,188,188,,,

01543,Hajime,CR 5,...is the true form of Nagito's malice.,0,5,0,190,190,,,
01544,Hajime,Trial 5,This should be the truth behind Nagito's trap.,0,5,0,191,191,,,
01545,Hajime,Trial 5,Nagito believed in his talent as the Ultimate Lucky Student.,0,5,0,192,192,,,
01546,Hajime,Trial 5,...,0,5,0,193,193,,,
01547,Hajime,Trial 5,You're right. The same thing happened when he cleared the Final Dead Room at the Funhouse.,0,5,0,194,194,,,
01548,Hajime,Trial 5,"But his luck doesn't have anything to do with the case this time, right?",0,5,0,195,195,,,

01552,Hajime,Trial 5,Huh?,0,5,0,199,199,,,
01553,Hajime,Trial 5,Ch-Chiaki?,0,5,0,200,200,,,
01554,Hajime,Trial 5,You want us... to guess?,0,5,0,201,201,,,
01555,Hajime,Trial 5,What? What does that mean?,0,5,0,202,202,,,
01556,Hajime,Trial 5,Wh-why?,0,5,0,203,203,,,
01557,Hajime,Trial 5,Why?,0,5,0,204,204,,,
01558,Hajime,Trial 5,Why!?,0,5,0,205,205,,,
01559,Hajime,Trial 5,"Seriously, why?",0,5,0,206,206,,,
01560,Hajime,Trial 5,I-it's... You...,0,5,0,207,207,,,
01561,Hajime,Trial 5,"Chiaki, you're the traitor?",0,5,0,208,208,,,

01563,Hajime,Trial 5,F-favor? Me?,0,5,0,210,210,,,
01564,Hajime,Trial 5,What?,0,5,0,211,211,,,
01565,Hajime,Trial 5,What are you saying? Why do I have to do that?,0,5,0,212,212,,,
01566,Hajime,Trial 5,"Whether I can prove it or not, that's not the problem!",0,5,0,213,213,,,
01567,Hajime,Trial 5,Don't you understand? You may as well be asking me to kill you!,0,5,0,214,214,,,
01568,Hajime,Trial 5,I... There's no way I can do that!,0,5,0,215,215,,,
01569,Hajime,Trial 5,Gh-!,0,5,0,216,216,,,
01570,Hajime,Trial 5,...,0,5,0,217,217,,,
01571,Hajime,Trial 5,When we investigated Nagito's cottage I discovered a notebook with an Usami logo on it.,0,5,0,218,218,,,
01572,Hajime,Trial 5,"That's... your notebook, right? The one Nagito stole from you.",0,5,0,219,219,,,
01573,Hajime,Trial 5,Nagito was probably looking for that too so that might be why he stole the notebook.,0,5,0,220,220,,,
01574,Hajime,Trial 5,"But you wouldn't know who the traitor is just by reading this notebook. Of course, Nagito wouldn't know either.",0,5,0,221,221,,,
01575,Hajime,Trial 5,"However, it's different for me...",0,5,0,222,222,,,
01576,Hajime,Trial 5,It took me this long but I finally understand.,0,5,0,223,223,,,
01577,Hajime,Trial 5,"First of all, this isn't Monomi's diary. Apparently she can't write.",0,5,0,224,224,,,
01578,Hajime,Trial 5,"Someone conected to Monomi. Meaning, it's not a mistake to think that the traitor wrote it.",0,5,0,225,225,,,
01579,Hajime,Trial 5,"Because, there's an entry written in here that only me and one other person would know.",0,5,0,226,226,,,
01580,Hajime,Trial 5,"In the notebook, there was a specific entry.",0,5,0,227,227,,,
01581,Hajime,Trial 5,"There it is. It's true, I tried to go inside the Final Dead Room.",0,5,0,228,228,,,
01582,Hajime,Trial 5,But the only one who knew that...,0,5,0,229,229,,,
01583,Hajime,Trial 5,"That's right, the only person who knew that is... Chiaki.",0,5,0,230,230,,,
01584,Hajime,Trial 5,That's why Chiaki is the only person who could've possibly written about this.,0,5,0,231,231,,,
01585,Hajime,Trial 5,"Chiaki probably knew the bomb was a fake, that's why she also knew Nagito's trap was a bluff.",0,5,0,232,232,,,
01586,Hajime,Trial 5,Of course not!,0,5,0,233,233,,,
01587,Hajime,Trial 5,"But, then nobody will be saved!",0,5,0,234,234,,,
01588,Hajime,Trial 5,That's not it! Sonia shouldn't have been the only one who knew the bomb was a fake.,0,5,0,235,235,,,
01589,Hajime,Trial 5,Monomi was also there when you found out the bomb at the military base wasn't real.,0,5,0,236,236,,,
01590,Hajime,Trial 5,You said so yourself.,0,5,0,237,237,,,

01592,Hajime,Trial 5,Sonia...,0,5,0,239,239,,,
01593,Hajime,Trial 5,Knowing it was a fake isn't the problem.,0,5,0,240,240,,,
01594,Hajime,Trial 5,What matters is who told her.,0,5,0,241,241,,,
01595,Hajime,Trial 5,What matters is that she heard about it from Monomi.,0,5,0,242,242,,,
01596,Hajime,Trial 5,You're right. Monokuma probably knew the bomb was a fake.,0,5,0,243,243,,,

01923,Hajime,CG,Huh?,0,99,0,135,135,,,
01924,Hajime,CG,If you didn't see anything after you swam for three hours it's more than difficult. It's impossible.,0,99,0,136,136,,,

01955,Hajime,CG,It sure is... dark.,0,99,0,167,167,,,
01956,Hajime,CG,"That's not it, it looks like the sprinklers activated.",0,99,0,168,168,,,
01957,Hajime,CG,I see. So that's why you're the only one who knew the bombs at the military base were fake.,0,99,0,169,169,,,

01999,Kyoko,Trial 6,Izuru... Kamukura?,21,6,0,20,20,,,
02000,Kyoko,Trial 6,Even within Hope's Peak Academy there's very little information about a person called Izuru Kamukura.,21,6,0,21,21,,,

02005,Kyoko,Trial 6,What did they... do to him?,21,6,0,26,26,,,
02006,Kyoko,Trial 6,D-did they... really do something like that?,21,6,0,27,27,,,
02007,Kyoko,Trial 6,That's not it. What we're saying is...,21,6,0,28,28,,,

02029,Kyoko,CG,Godo luck. I'm not going to help you that much.,21,99,0,112,112,,,

02035,Mahiru,Trial 1,Huh? What does that mean?,12,1,0,2,2,,,
02036,Mahiru,Trial 1,"So that's why you think it's impossible that the killer moved the body. I see, I get your point.",12,1,0,3,3,,,
02037,Mahiru,Trial 1,"If he knew beforehand he probably would've done something about it before the blackout, right?",12,1,0,4,4,,,
02038,Mahiru,Trial 1,"No, that's obviously wrong. It should be the other way around.",12,1,0,5,5,,,
02039,Mahiru,Trial 1,"Seriously? The killer used those night vision goggles, not Byakuya.",12,1,0,6,6,,,
02040,Mahiru,Trial 1,If you just use common sense...,12,1,0,7,7,,,
02041,Mahiru,Trial 1,...the killer obviously used those night vision goggles.,12,1,0,8,8,,,
02042,Mahiru,Trial 1,That's gotta be it!,12,1,0,9,9,,,
02043,Mahiru,Trial 1,"Because, if they used night vision goggles...",12,1,0,10,10,,,
02044,Mahiru,Trial 1,...then they could've killed Byakuya even in the dark!,12,1,0,11,11,,,
02045,Mahiru,Trial 1,"I mean, in reality that's what happened...",12,1,0,12,12,,,
02046,Mahiru,Trial 1,So those goggles were planned in advance.,12,1,0,13,13,,,
02047,Mahiru,Trial 1,The killer brought them to the crime scene!,12,1,0,14,14,,,
02048,Mahiru,Trial 1,Definitely? But why?,12,1,0,15,15,,,
02049,Mahiru,Trial 1,"I see... When you put it like that, it makess sense.",12,1,0,16,16,,,
02050,Mahiru,Trial 1,"Now that you mention it, that applies to the dangerous items he confiscated as well.",12,1,0,17,17,,,
02051,Mahiru,Trial 1,It's one thing to be a little cautious but performing a body check is a bit much.,12,1,0,18,18,,,
02052,Mahiru,Trial 1,"Well, obviously the killer.",12,1,0,19,19,,,
02053,Mahiru,Trial 1,But painting them with glowing paint? It's as if they knew the blackout was going to happen.,12,1,0,20,20,,,
02054,Mahiru,Trial 1,Ah! Then the person who was in the bathroom that whole time was actually...,12,1,0,21,21,,,
02055,Mahiru,Trial 1,"There's no way she'd actually say that. Gosh, you are so insensitive!",12,1,0,22,22,,,
02056,Mahiru,Trial 1,"Hey, weren't you guys any basic manners or were you locked in a locker room?",12,1,0,23,23,,,

02058,Mahiru,Trial 1,"If the food had laxatives in it, I'm pretty sure Akane would've had stomach issues as well.",12,1,0,25,25,,,
02059,Mahiru,Trial 1,"Fuyuhiko should apologize, not you! He's the one who made the laxatives accusation.",12,1,0,26,26,,,
02060,Mahiru,Trial 1,Or maybe they caused a power surge?,12,1,0,27,27,,,
02061,Mahiru,Trial 1,"So by leaving those irons on the storage room, they deliberately caused a power surge.",12,1,0,28,28,,,
02062,Mahiru,Trial 1,Shut up! You guys just stay quiet!,12,1,0,29,29,,,
02063,Mahiru,Trial 1,"S-stop it! If everyone acts like this, I-I'm gonna...",12,1,0,30,30,,,
02064,Mahiru,Trial 1,"The diagram of where everyone was standing before the blackout, right? Umm... Here it is!",12,1,0,31,31,,,
02065,Mahiru,Trial 1,Could it be? Did you give yourself cleaning duty on purpose so you could hide the knife under the table?,12,1,0,32,32,,,
02066,Mahiru,Trial 1,"You rigged the drawing, didn't you! That's how you got picked to clean the dining hall, isn't it?",12,1,0,33,33,,,
02067,Mahiru,Trial 1,"Well, just admit it already!",12,1,0,34,34,,,
02068,Mahiru,Trial 1,Don't tell me... Is this your true nature? Were you lying to us this entire time?,12,1,0,35,35,,,
02069,Mahiru,Trial 1,If that's true then how did you conveniently get picked for cleaning duty?,12,1,0,36,36,,,
02070,Mahiru,Trial 1,"Hey, why are you threatening her?",12,1,0,37,37,,,
02071,Mahiru,Trial 1,"Wh-what are you saying? No one else can be the killer, it has to be you!",12,1,0,38,38,,,
02072,Mahiru,Trial 1,H-hold on!,12,1,0,39,39,,,
02073,Mahiru,Trial 1,Are you saying you're not the killer?,12,1,0,40,40,,,
02074,Mahiru,Trial 1,Sh-shut up! We'll be the judge of that!,12,1,0,41,41,,,
02075,Mahiru,Trial 1,U-under the floorboards?,12,1,0,42,42,,,
02076,Mahiru,Trial 1,Umm... The only person who wasn't at the party...,12,1,0,43,43,,,
02077,Mahiru,Trial 1,Judging from the photo I took before the blackout...,12,1,0,44,44,,,
02078,Mahiru,Trial 1,It obviously has to be him!,12,1,0,45,45,,,
02079,Mahiru,Trial 1,"Oh really? What happened to the tough guy who was saying stuff like ""I can do it""?",12,1,0,46,46,,,
02080,Mahiru,Trial 1,See? You're making threats again!,12,1,0,47,47,,,
02081,Mahiru,Trial 1,But when the party started...,12,1,0,48,48,,,
02082,Mahiru,Trial 1,"...nobody saw you, you know?",12,1,0,49,49,,,
02083,Mahiru,Trial 1,That means you have no alibi!,12,1,0,50,50,,,
02084,Mahiru,Trial 1,"It's still your fault. Like, why were you even lurking around the old building in the first place?",12,1,0,51,51,,,
02085,Mahiru,Trial 1,Repeating yourself just makes it even more suspicious!,12,1,0,52,52,,,
02086,Mahiru,Trial 1,Teruteru's the killer? Is that true?,12,1,0,53,53,,,
02087,Mahiru,Trial 1,If that's the case then Gundham should know! He actually went under the floorboards.,12,1,0,54,54,,,
02088,Mahiru,Trial 1,Wh-what? A shining liquid in the dark?,12,1,0,55,55,,,
02089,Mahiru,Trial 1,Y-you again? Just stop already!,12,1,0,56,56,,,
02090,Mahiru,Trial 1,"But Teruteru was in the kitchen the moment the blackout occurred, right? So why was he in the dining hall?",12,1,0,57,57,,,
02091,Mahiru,Trial 1,Maybe it was a recording or something?,12,1,0,58,58,,,
02092,Mahiru,Trial 1,"Is that true, Teruteru?",12,1,0,59,59,,,
02093,Mahiru,Trial 1,Huh? Was Teruteru actually there during that time?,12,1,0,60,60,,,
02094,Mahiru,Trial 1,There's no way it would slip from your mind! Especially not a pervert like you!,12,1,0,61,61,,,
02095,Mahiru,Trial 1,"Come on, Monomi! Enough with the whimpering and translate!",12,1,0,62,62,,,
02096,Mahiru,Trial 1,Huh? The iron skewer?,12,1,0,63,63,,,
02097,Mahiru,Trial 1,Huh? Where did Monokuma go?,12,1,0,64,64,,,
02098,Mahiru,Trial 1,Y-you don't need to translate anymore. Somehow I can... tell what he's trying to say.,12,1,0,65,65,,,

02122,Mahiru,Game,Ohh...,12,99,0,23,23,,,
02123,Mahiru,Game,Could it be...,12,99,0,24,24,,,
02124,Mahiru,Game,Then...,12,99,0,25,25,,,
02125,Mahiru,Game,What... is this?,12,99,0,26,26,,,
02126,Mahiru,Game,What's going on?,12,99,0,27,27,,,

02155,Mahiru,Game,Ah-!,12,99,0,56,56,,,
02156,Mahiru,Game,Hey...,12,99,0,57,57,,,
02157,Mahiru,Game,But...,12,99,0,58,58,,,
02158,Mahiru,Game,This is the worst...,12,99,0,59,59,,,
02159,Mahiru,Game,Noooooo!,12,99,0,60,60,,,
02160,Mahiru,Game,Then...,12,99,0,61,61,,,
02161,Mahiru,Game,Your reasoning is out of focus!,12,99,0,62,62,,,
02162,Mahiru,Bonus,"So, when we're finally able to get out of here together, maybe we can...",12,99,0,63,63,,,
02163,Mahiru,Bonus,"Say ""Cheese""! Just kidding!",12,99,0,64,64,,,
02164,Mahiru,CG,"Hey, could you be... You're also a freshman at this school, right?",12,99,0,101,101,,,
02165,Mahiru,CG,Umm... It looks like a stuffed animal.,12,99,0,102,102,,,
02166,Mahiru,CG,You seem a little too open. Like you're covering too many bases by yourself.,12,99,0,103,103,,,
02167,Mahiru,CG,We... We should help her up!,12,99,0,104,104,,,
02168,Mahiru,CG,"I don't care what you say, you're totally pigging out!",12,99,0,105,105,,,
02169,Mahiru,CG,"Hey everyone, while we're at it why don't I take pictures for you guys?",12,99,0,106,106,,,
02170,Mahiru,CG,There... There's no way I can do that!,12,99,0,107,107,,,
02171,Mahiru,CG,N-no...,12,99,0,108,108,,,
02172,Mahiru,CG,Nooooooooooooooo!,12,99,0,109,109,,,
02173,Mahiru,CG,Ah- it's a blackout!,12,99,0,110,110,,,
02174,Mahiru,CG,"E-everyone, calm down! We gotta stay calm in a situation like this!",12,99,0,111,111,,,
02175,Nagito,Trial 1,"Before we begin, I'd like to confirm one thing. Is there really a killer among us?",1,1,0,1,1,,,
02176,Nagito,Trial 1,"A-anyway, why don't we try talking about the most pressing issue on our minds?",1,1,0,2,2,,,
02177,Nagito,Trial 1,Where we found the body. It's very strange to find a body underneath the table.,1,1,0,3,3,,,
02178,Nagito,Trial 1,Why was Byakuya's body...,1,1,0,4,4,,,
02179,Nagito,Trial 1,...in a place like that?,1,1,0,5,5,,,
02180,Nagito,Trial 1,Try to remember what the body looked like when we found it under the table.,1,1,0,6,6,,,
02181,Nagito,Trial 1,Though there was a lot of blood anywhere there was no sign the killer actually dragged the body through it.,1,1,0,7,7,,,
02182,Nagito,Trial 1,So Byakuya snuck under the table for reasons unknown and that's when he was killed.,1,1,0,8,8,,,
02183,Nagito,Trial 1,"Then, shortly thereafter, we found his body under the table.",1,1,0,9,9,,,
02184,Nagito,Trial 1,"The reason why is probably connected to what Byakuya was doing during the party, don't you think?",1,1,0,10,10,,,
02185,Nagito,Trial 1,He probably knew someone was planning to commit a murder.,1,1,0,11,11,,,
02186,Nagito,Trial 1,"You think so too, right Hajime?",1,1,0,12,12,,,
02187,Nagito,Trial 1,Hajime and I found this in Byakuya's cottage.,1,1,0,13,13,,,
02188,Nagito,Trial 1,He probably decided to throw a party because of the letter.,1,1,0,14,14,,,
02189,Nagito,Trial 1,"By gathering everyone in one place, he tried to create a situation where everyone could keep tabs on each other.",1,1,0,15,15,,,
02190,Nagito,Trial 1,"In doing so, he tried to put the writer of the letter in a situation where they couldn't act.",1,1,0,16,16,,,
02191,Nagito,Trial 1,As long as he was determined not to let any of us die he couldn't take that risk.,1,1,0,17,17,,,
02192,Nagito,Trial 1,His strong sense of responsibility made him believe that letter was legitimate.,1,1,0,18,18,,,
02193,Nagito,Trial 1,If he had we would've panicked. Byakuya probably knew that too.,1,1,0,19,19,,,
02194,Nagito,Trial 1,Which is why those three irons were arranged to cause the blackout.,1,1,0,20,20,,,
02195,Nagito,Trial 1,They probably checked the old building's energy usage in advance and used the irons to nearly max it out.,1,1,0,21,21,,,
02196,Nagito,Trial 1,So once they set the air conditioner's timers they just had to wait until they started up on their own.,1,1,0,22,22,,,
02197,Nagito,Trial 1,"No, the breaker in the office was built into a high area of the wall that's impossible to reach.",1,1,0,23,23,,,
02198,Nagito,Trial 1,"Resetting the breaker in that darkness would've been impossible, no matter what.",1,1,0,24,24,,,
02199,Nagito,Trial 1,"It's alright, you don't have to worry.",1,1,0,25,25,,,
02200,Nagito,Trial 1,"Because... they're just a petty killer, right? They can't defeat symbols of hope like you guys!",1,1,0,26,26,,,
02201,Nagito,Trial 1,There's no way everybody will lose now. This little incident will just be a stepping stool for you all.,1,1,0,27,27,,,
02202,Nagito,Trial 1,"In the end, hope always wins. That's what I believe!",1,1,0,28,28,,,
02203,Nagito,Trial 1,Huh? What do you mean?,1,1,0,29,29,,,
02204,Nagito,Trial 1,"Oh, is that so? Well, let's just put that minor detail aside for now and talk about the incident.",1,1,0,30,30,,,
02205,Nagito,Trial 1,"For now, we found out how the blackout occurred but the question is who caused it, right?",1,1,0,31,31,,,
02206,Nagito,Trial 1,Anybody could've hid and set the timers for the air conditioners.,1,1,0,32,32,,,
02207,Nagito,Trial 1,Setting up the irons in the storage room could've been done before Byakuya set foot in the old building.,1,1,0,33,33,,,
02208,Nagito,Trial 1,"What a shame, any one of us is capable of that.",1,1,0,34,34,,,
02209,Nagito,Trial 1,Unfortunately it's the truth...,1,1,0,35,35,,,
02210,Nagito,Trial 1,Despite the fact that we discussed this at length there's not even one clue that leads to the killer.,1,1,0,36,36,,,
02211,Nagito,Trial 1,But that might be because there's no way any of us could be a killer.,1,1,0,37,37,,,
02212,Nagito,Trial 1,"Anyway, I have an idea about what we all should do at this point.",1,1,0,38,38,,,
02213,Nagito,Trial 1,Has anyone thought about our situation like this?,1,1,0,39,39,,,
02214,Nagito,Trial 1,"Instead of surviving by doubting others, isn't it better to get killed for believing in others?",1,1,0,40,40,,,
02215,Nagito,Trial 1,"Hehehe, you guys only think there's something wrong with me because there's something wrong with you!",1,1,0,41,41,,,
02216,Nagito,Trial 1,"Suspecting each other like this, there's no way that's healthy behaviour.",1,1,0,42,42,,,
02217,Nagito,Trial 1,Let's stop this already! We don't have to find out who the killer is!,1,1,0,43,43,,,
02218,Nagito,Trial 1,I can't stand this anymore! I don't wanna do this to my friends!,1,1,0,44,44,,,
02219,Nagito,Trial 1,"We're all friends, aren't we? There's no way one friend would murder another.",1,1,0,45,45,,,
02220,Nagito,Trial 1,Who cares? Let's just give up already...,1,1,0,46,46,,,
02221,Nagito,Trial 1,There are no clues that lead to the killer anyway. Not a single one...,1,1,0,47,47,,,
02222,Nagito,Trial 1,Ah-!,1,1,0,48,48,,,
02223,Nagito,Trial 1,Did you say something?,1,1,0,49,49,,,
02224,Nagito,Trial 1,"I see... Then care to tell me, what's this ""clue"" you're talking about?",1,1,0,50,50,,,
02225,Nagito,Trial 1,Didn't we already cover that? They used glowing paint as a mark.,1,1,0,51,51,,,
02226,Nagito,Trial 1,The desk lamp? I hope you don't mean they turned on a light or something.,1,1,0,52,52,,,
02227,Nagito,Trial 1,M-me?,1,1,0,53,53,,,
02228,Nagito,Trial 1,Th-that's just a coincidence!,1,1,0,54,54,,,
02229,Nagito,Trial 1,Th-that's-!,1,1,0,55,55,,,
02230,Nagito,Trial 1,"S-seriously, that's all just a coincidence!",1,1,0,56,56,,,
02231,Nagito,Trial 1,...,1,1,0,57,57,,,
02232,Nagito,Trial 1,Gh-ghah-ahh!,1,1,0,58,58,,,
02233,Nagito,Trial 1,Eh-ehh...,1,1,0,59,59,,,
02234,Nagito,Trial 1,Gh-hh-hehe!,1,1,0,60,60,,,
02235,Nagito,Trial 1,Gh-kh-khhh!,1,1,0,61,61,,,
02236,Nagito,Trial 1,Ehe-ehehehe!,1,1,0,62,62,,,
02237,Nagito,Trial 1,Ahahahahahaaaaaa! Ahahahahahahahaaa!,1,1,0,63,63,,,
02238,Nagito,Trial 1,The Ultimates are working together to combat the despair of their friend's death!,1,1,0,64,64,,,
02239,Nagito,Trial 1,"Ah, how wonderful! How beautiful it is!",1,1,0,65,65,,,
02240,Nagito,Trial 1,"Let's cut to the chase. You're correct, it was my doing all along!",1,1,0,66,66,,,
02241,Nagito,Trial 1,I'm the one who hid the knife under the table before the party started.,1,1,0,67,67,,,
02242,Nagito,Trial 1,I'm the one who used the power cord to find my way to the table in the dark.,1,1,0,68,68,,,
02243,Nagito,Trial 1,"And of course, I'm the one who caused the blackout.",1,1,0,69,69,,,
02244,Nagito,Trial 1,"After all, there's no way I'd knowingly whip out a kinfe in front of everyone, right?",1,1,0,70,70,,,
02245,Nagito,Trial 1,But... I never expected Byakuya to have night vision goggles.,1,1,0,71,71,,,
02246,Nagito,Trial 1,Because of that we had ourselves a little scuffle under the table and... well... You all saw how that played out.,1,1,0,72,72,,,
02247,Nagito,Trial 1,But with a twist ending like this I think we can all agree that this ended up being a very interesting mystery.,1,1,0,73,73,,,
02248,Nagito,Trial 1,Ghahaha! Byakuya performed admirably!,1,1,0,74,74,,,
02249,Nagito,Trial 1,Me? Lie? That's outrageous! There's no way someone like me could ever lie to you guys.,1,1,0,75,75,,,
02250,Nagito,Trial 1,I understand better than anyone else that I'm ultimately worthless...,1,1,0,76,76,,,
02251,Nagito,Trial 1,"I'm too arrogant to have dreams or cling to hope, I'm too disdainful to actually try at anything...",1,1,0,77,77,,,
02252,Nagito,Trial 1,"I've made peace with the fact that I'm a lowly, stupid, insignificant human who can't do anything right.",1,1,0,78,78,,,
02253,Nagito,Trial 1,"Yup, I sure did.",1,1,0,79,79,,,
02254,Nagito,Trial 1,"There's nobody  else on this island whose island is that painful to look at, right?",1,1,0,80,80,,,
02255,Nagito,Trial 1,"I think, somewhere deep in my heart, I was probably hoping to find someone who would stop my evil deeds.",1,1,0,81,81,,,
02256,Nagito,Trial 1,"Well, I bet if that really was my reason at least some of you would feel sorry for me.",1,1,0,82,82,,,
02257,Nagito,Trial 1,"Yep, that's true too! But you're wrong about one thing...",1,1,0,83,83,,,
02258,Nagito,Trial 1,"I didn't need to rig the drawing for cleaning duty, you know?",1,1,0,84,84,,,
02259,Nagito,Trial 1,"I see... Well, there's no way I'd expect you to remember it. A worthless talent for a worthless human...",1,1,0,85,85,,,
02260,Nagito,Trial 1,"That's right, I just trusted my luck. I trusted I'd be picked for cleaning duty.",1,1,0,86,86,,,
02261,Nagito,Trial 1,"It's not just luck. It's true my talent sucks but I'm still the Ultimate Lucky Student, you know?",1,1,0,87,87,,,
02262,Nagito,Trial 1,"At the time, Hajime said I wasn't lucky. But it was actually the opposite.",1,1,0,88,88,,,
02263,Nagito,Trial 1,"I was lucky! That's why I got picked for cleaning duty, just like I wanted.",1,1,0,89,89,,,
02264,Nagito,Trial 1,Hmph!,1,1,0,90,90,,,
02265,Nagito,Trial 1,"Byakuya was a very capable leader. For someone like him to get killed, oh, the despair it brings...",1,1,0,91,91,,,
02266,Nagito,Trial 1,It's only fitting that you symbols of hope should use his death as a stepping stone to shine even brighter!,1,1,0,92,92,,,
02267,Nagito,Trial 1,That was my only motivation!,1,1,0,93,93,,,
02268,Nagito,Trial 1,"Is this what you're trying to say, Mikan?",1,1,0,94,94,,,
02269,Nagito,Trial 1,"""As long as we can't prove that the knife is the murder weapon we can't assume that I'm the killer.""",1,1,0,95,95,,,
02270,Nagito,Trial 1,"Hey, don't blame me. Mikan's the one who said it.",1,1,0,96,96,,,
02271,Nagito,Trial 1,Who knows?,1,1,0,97,97,,,
02272,Nagito,Trial 1,Keh...,1,1,0,98,98,,,
02273,Nagito,Trial 1,"Nobody can see in the dark, no matter how hard you think about it. The truth is beyond your sight.",1,1,0,99,99,,,
02274,Nagito,Trial 1,Don't you think that's a pretty clever metaphor despite the fact that it came from me?,1,1,0,100,100,,,
02275,Nagito,Trial 1,Not it? What's not it?,1,1,0,101,101,,,
02276,Nagito,Trial 1,Such perceptive hearing! Impressive! I'd expect no less from the Ultimate Musician!,1,1,0,102,102,,,
02277,Nagito,Trial 1,"Well, that's actually what happened.",1,1,0,103,103,,,
02278,Nagito,Trial 1,"As a sign of respect for Ibuki's talent, I have a small confession to make.",1,1,0,104,104,,,
02279,Nagito,Trial 1,I was actually shoved out from under the table by Byakuya.,1,1,0,105,105,,,
02280,Nagito,Trial 1,Just as the blackout occurred I hurried to duck under the table and grab the knife.,1,1,0,106,106,,,
02281,Nagito,Trial 1,"But Byakuya, wearing his night vision goggles, caught me and shoved me right out from under the table.",1,1,0,107,107,,,
02282,Nagito,Trial 1,"That's right, I'm so incompetent that I couldn't even grab the knife.",1,1,0,108,108,,,
02283,Nagito,Trial 1,After getting shoved out from under the table I was just as confused as you guys.,1,1,0,109,109,,,
02284,Nagito,Trial 1,I lost sight of the glowing paint and I didn't even know where the power cord was.,1,1,0,110,110,,,
02285,Nagito,Trial 1,Before I realized it the lights had come back on and Byakuya's body was lying under the table.,1,1,0,111,111,,,
02286,Nagito,Trial 1,From the very beginning the idea to throw a party...,1,1,0,112,112,,,
02287,Nagito,Trial 1,"...hiding the knife, setting up the blackout, it was all going according to plan.",1,1,0,113,113,,,
02288,Nagito,Trial 1,But unfortunately my plan failed. And all thanks to Byakuya's night vision goggles.,1,1,0,114,114,,,
02289,Nagito,Trial 1,"What happened after that, even I don't know.",1,1,0,115,115,,,
02290,Nagito,Trial 1,Meaninglessness... What other word is brimming with so much despair?,1,1,0,116,116,,,
02291,Nagito,Trial 1,"But you can't give up! You need to have hope, do your best and move forward!",1,1,0,117,117,,,
02292,Nagito,Trial 1,Rising to the challenge again and again is why you guys are the symbols of hope!,1,1,0,118,118,,,
02293,Nagito,Trial 1,"Well, what now?",1,1,0,119,119,,,
02294,Nagito,Trial 1,If the knife isn't the murder weapon there's no definitive proof that I'm the killer.,1,1,0,120,120,,,
02295,Nagito,Trial 1,Nobody's ever complimented me on my appearance before! Not even my own mother...,1,1,0,121,121,,,
02296,Nagito,Trial 1,"I didn't get any blood on me? That is weird, heh...",1,1,0,122,122,,,
02297,Nagito,Trial 1,Something that might've been used to blood splatter... What do you think it could've been?,1,1,0,123,123,,,
02298,Nagito,Trial 1,"Hmm... I guess we did something I could've used. Isn't that right, Hajime?",1,1,0,124,124,,,
02299,Nagito,Trial 1,"Wearing a tablecloth, going under the table, getting a knife in a blackout and stabbing someone...",1,1,0,125,125,,,
02300,Nagito,Trial 1,"That's not just impossible for someone like me, wouldn't it also be impossible for you guys too?",1,1,0,126,126,,,
02301,Nagito,Trial 1,Huh? Hajime... You look like you're onto something.,1,1,0,127,127,,,
02302,Nagito,Trial 1,"If so, that means the killer was able to get under the floorboards. But from where, and how?",1,1,0,128,128,,,
02303,Nagito,Trial 1,It appears we're getting close to the final stage.,1,1,0,129,129,,,
02304,Nagito,Trial 1,"The blackened or the spotless, which is superior? I think it's time to settle this.",1,1,0,130,130,,,
02305,Nagito,Trial 1,I see. I never considered the portable stove... But there's a hole in your argument.,1,1,0,131,131,,,
02306,Nagito,Trial 1,"Now then Hajime, will you battle against me?",1,1,0,132,132,,,
02307,Nagito,Trial 1,Will you be able to break through my argument?,1,1,0,133,133,,,
02308,Nagito,Trial 1,Did you forget what Kazuichi said earlier?,1,1,0,134,134,,,
02309,Nagito,Trial 1,He said the hall was too dark to see the office.,1,1,0,135,135,,,
02310,Nagito,Trial 1,The light from the stove that you mentioned...,1,1,0,136,136,,,
02311,Nagito,Trial 1,...it contradicts his testimony!,1,1,0,137,137,,,
02312,Nagito,Trial 1,Or are you intentionally doubting his testimony?,1,1,0,138,138,,,
02313,Nagito,Trial 1,The reason Kazuichi couldn't see the office...,1,1,0,139,139,,,
02314,Nagito,Trial 1,"...was because the hallway was dark, right?",1,1,0,140,140,,,
02315,Nagito,Trial 1,So if a light was shining in such a dark hallway...,1,1,0,141,141,,,
02316,Nagito,Trial 1,...wouldn't Kazuichi have seen it?,1,1,0,142,142,,,
02317,Nagito,Trial 1,"After all, he was walking near the hallway, right?",1,1,0,143,143,,,
02318,Nagito,Trial 1,Huh? What are you talking about?,1,1,0,144,144,,,
02319,Nagito,Trial 1,"I see... To actually notice the fire door, just as expected of the Ultimate...",1,1,0,145,145,,,
02320,Nagito,Trial 1,"Oh, you still don't remember your talent, do you?",1,1,0,146,146,,,
02321,Nagito,Trial 1,"You sound so scary! If you're that angry, why don't you take a deep breath?",1,1,0,147,147,,,
02322,Nagito,Trial 1,"Fine, I get it. You're telling me to pass the torch, right?",1,1,0,148,148,,,
02323,Nagito,Trial 1,"We're going to ask the real killer, not an impostor like me, to show themselves!",1,1,0,149,149,,,
02324,Nagito,Trial 1,If you think I am I really don't mind.,1,1,0,150,150,,,
02325,Nagito,Trial 1,"Whatever conclusion you Ultimates arrive at, I will accept it. No matter what it is.",1,1,0,151,151,,,
02326,Nagito,Trial 1,"Ahh, Teruteru... That attitude is so not like you...",1,1,0,152,152,,,
02327,Nagito,Trial 1,For the Ultimate Cook to get so upset...,1,1,0,153,153,,,
02328,Nagito,Trial 1,"If you fall to aspersions like this, who will be there to support the future of the culinary arts?",1,1,0,154,154,,,
02329,Nagito,Trial 1,"That's right, for the future of the culinary arts you must face this and fight it fair and square!",1,1,0,155,155,,,
02330,Nagito,Trial 1,Let's assume that the killer used a light and that they used the fire door to mask that light...,1,1,0,156,156,,,
02331,Nagito,Trial 1,...and that they moved to the storage room and snuck under the floorboards. Then what?,1,1,0,157,157,,,
02332,Nagito,Trial 1,"It's dark under the floorboards, too. So how would they be able to stab Byakuya?",1,1,0,158,158,,,
02333,Nagito,Trial 1,"You're not gonna say they shined the light on Byakuya, right? The plan would've been ruined if he noticed.",1,1,0,159,159,,,
02334,Nagito,Trial 1,"There's no way you can answer, right? You personally haven't investigated what's beneath the floorboards.",1,1,0,160,160,,,
02335,Nagito,Trial 1,"So, the killer used the mark that I prepared for finding the knife as a mark for stabbing...",1,1,0,161,161,,,
02336,Nagito,Trial 1,I see. That's why Byakuya got killed when he took the knife!,1,1,0,162,162,,,
02337,Nagito,Trial 1,Then can I ask everyone a question instead?,1,1,0,163,163,,,
02338,Nagito,Trial 1,If Teruteru is the killer that would mean he went to the storage room during the blackout.,1,1,0,164,164,,,
02339,Nagito,Trial 1,And just what did Ibuki hear during the blackout?,1,1,0,165,165,,,
02340,Nagito,Trial 1,Doesn't that prove Teruteru was in the dining hall during the blackout?,1,1,0,166,166,,,
02341,Nagito,Trial 1,"That's right, Teruteru was in the dining hall. Not the storage room. Which means, he's not the killer.",1,1,0,167,167,,,
02342,Nagito,Trial 1,"You should be so proud of yourself, Hajime. You're just progressing toward the hope you believe in.",1,1,0,168,168,,,
02343,Nagito,Trial 1,"Now Hajime, show me more of your hope. Will that be enough to crush Teruteru's hope?",1,1,0,169,169,,,
02344,Nagito,Trial 1,Let me ask you again...,1,1,0,170,170,,,
02345,Nagito,Trial 1,Did you go to the storage room during the blackout?,1,1,0,171,171,,,
02346,Nagito,Trial 1,"Well, I believe so. There's no way he could've gone back and forth in that dark hallway...",1,1,0,172,172,,,
02347,Nagito,Trial 1,Something like this shouldn't be decided by gut instinct! People's lifes are at stake!,1,1,0,173,173,,,
02348,Nagito,Trial 1,Hmm... I guess you might have to give up now.,1,1,0,174,174,,,
02349,Nagito,Trial 1,"Teruteru, I'm disappointed too, y'know?",1,1,0,175,175,,,
02350,Nagito,Trial 1,It's lonely watching someone I admire reach the limits of their hope. It kind of feels like a broken dream...,1,1,0,176,176,,,
02351,Nagito,Trial 1,"Huh? But it's already decided, right?",1,1,0,177,177,,,
02352,Nagito,Trial 1,"After all this, who cares about the weapon?",1,1,0,178,178,,,
02353,Nagito,Trial 1,As expected of Teruteru! Such a fantastic weapon from the Ultimate Chef!,1,1,0,179,179,,,
02354,Nagito,Trial 1,Ah...,1,1,0,180,180,,,
02355,Nagito,Trial 1,"Jeez, what a disappointment...",1,1,0,181,181,,,
02356,Nagito,Trial 1,Such an unseemly defense from an Ultimate like you! Can you really call that hope?,1,1,0,182,182,,,
02357,Nagito,Trial 2,Heh...,1,2,0,1,1,,,
02358,Nagito,Trial 2,"Nevertheless, we shouldn't ignore it. After all, a game is the motive this time.",1,2,0,2,2,,,
02359,Nagito,Trial 2,I'm sure everyone who's beaten the game already knows that it's based on an actual murder case.,1,2,0,3,3,,,
02360,Nagito,Trial 2,"It means, Twilight Syndrome Murder Case is a non-fiction game.",1,2,0,4,4,,,
02361,Nagito,Trial 2,"Additionally, some of us are characters in that game too.",1,2,0,5,5,,,
02362,Nagito,Trial 2,"Anyway, let's move on. Next is Girl C.",1,2,0,6,6,,,
02363,Nagito,Trial 2,"Yeah, that's correct. Let's skip Girl E and talk about Guy F.",1,2,0,7,7,,,
02364,Nagito,Trial 2,"Ah, that reminds me. Wasn't there another person whose last name was also Kuzuryu?",1,2,0,8,8,,,
02365,Nagito,Trial 2,It was one of the names on the staff roll...,1,2,0,9,9,,,
02366,Nagito,Trial 2,"The names were Tsumiki, Koizumi, Saionji, Mioda, Sato, Kuzuryu and then another Kuzuryu.",1,2,0,10,10,,,
02367,Nagito,Trial 2,It's not like I'm wrong. That's how it's written on the staff roll.,1,2,0,11,11,,,
02368,Nagito,Trial 2,"Since you beat the game you probably know what this actually means, right?",1,2,0,12,12,,,
02369,Nagito,Trial 2,"By the way, what role did Guy F's little sister, the other Kuzuryu, play? You probably noticed, right?",1,2,0,13,13,,,
02370,Nagito,Trial 2,Based on Guy F's tone in the game it's clear that Girl E is not his little sister.,1,2,0,14,14,,,
02371,Nagito,Trial 2,So if the only person left is the dead high school girl then she must be Fuyuhiko's sister.,1,2,0,15,15,,,
02372,Nagito,Trial 2,"""Winning personality""? Are you praising me?",1,2,0,16,16,,,
02373,Nagito,Trial 2,It's not just a game! It's definitely based on true events.,1,2,0,17,17,,,
02374,Nagito,Trial 2,That's why it's the motive.,1,2,0,18,18,,,
02375,Nagito,Trial 2,"I see... So you're never gonna expect that the game is based on true events, huh?",1,2,0,19,19,,,
02376,Nagito,Trial 2,"Okay, I understand your attitude towards this class trial now.",1,2,0,20,20,,,
02377,Nagito,Trial 2,A mystery that easy would make me feel sad. It wouldn't be good enough to serve as everyone's stepping stone.,1,2,0,21,21,,,
02378,Nagito,Trial 2,That's why I'd be much happier if Fuyuhiko wasn't the killer!,1,2,0,22,22,,,
02379,Nagito,Trial 2,Then let's hurry up and solve it! Let's first figure out why Girl E was killed!,1,2,0,23,23,,,
02380,Nagito,Trial 2,Which means Girl E was killed as revenge for the dead high school girl.,1,2,0,24,24,,,
02381,Nagito,Trial 2,"What do you think, Fuyuhiko? Apparently Girl E was killed to avenge your little sister...",1,2,0,25,25,,,
02382,Nagito,Trial 2,But...?,1,2,0,26,26,,,
02383,Nagito,Trial 2,In order to make that clear we need to know more about the case involving the first victim's murder.,1,2,0,27,27,,,
02384,Nagito,Trial 2,"Yep, an understandable explanation. Just as expected from the Ultimate Gamer who excels at clearing games!",1,2,0,28,28,,,
02385,Nagito,Trial 2,"By the way, since it was never mentioned in the game we can exclude the possibility of there being a spare key.",1,2,0,29,29,,,
02386,Nagito,Trial 2,After she killed the first victim in the music room...,1,2,0,30,30,,,
02387,Nagito,Trial 2,What did Girl E do?,1,2,0,31,31,,,
02388,Nagito,Trial 2,"Actually, the murder was nearly finished by the time the four girls met in the entrance hall.",1,2,0,32,32,,,
02389,Nagito,Trial 2,"Girl E killed the victim in the music room, broke the window and went to the office to get the key.",1,2,0,33,33,,,
02390,Nagito,Trial 2,"With that key, she locked the music room from the hallway, returned the key to the office...",1,2,0,34,34,,,
02391,Nagito,Trial 2,...and went back to wait in front of the music room.,1,2,0,35,35,,,
02392,Nagito,Trial 2,All she had to do was break the vase in the next door class room as the four girls met by the entrance hall.,1,2,0,36,36,,,
02393,Nagito,Trial 2,But the real important talk begins now.,1,2,0,37,37,,,
02394,Nagito,Trial 2,Girl E had someone who can be called an accomplice! And that girl was actually... Girl D.,1,2,0,38,38,,,
02395,Nagito,Trial 2,"But she should've had a clear murderous intent. I mean, she choked her out and then bludgeoned her to death.",1,2,0,39,39,,,
02396,Nagito,Trial 2,"But Girl E was also killed by someone on the fourth day, or the game's last day.",1,2,0,40,40,,,
02397,Nagito,Trial 2,I might as well ask just in case. Who do you think killed Girl E?,1,2,0,41,41,,,
02398,Nagito,Trial 2,That's all you can say. If that game is telling the case it'd be a huge problem for you.,1,2,0,42,42,,,
02399,Nagito,Trial 2,Huh... They're not Hiyoko's footprints? That's strange...,1,2,0,43,43,,,
02400,Nagito,Trial 2,The footprint I collected from your room matches these footprints perfectly.,1,2,0,44,44,,,
02401,Nagito,Trial 2,Then you didn't meet up with Mahiru...,1,2,0,45,45,,,
02402,Nagito,Trial 2,...at the beach house?,1,2,0,46,46,,,
02403,Nagito,Trial 2,"The brand of gummies you eat only have strawberry, melon, grape and orange flavors, right?",1,2,0,47,47,,,
02404,Nagito,Trial 2,That's right! None of the gummy bag in her cottage had any yellow ones.,1,2,0,48,48,,,
02405,Nagito,Trial 2,"I'm pretty sure her death was instant too. I mean, her injury was only a single blow.",1,2,0,49,49,,,
02406,Nagito,Trial 2,That's why Mahiru isn't the one who blocked the door. Someone else used her body to block it.,1,2,0,50,50,,,
02407,Nagito,Trial 2,"Hey Hiyoko, now that our suspicions have been addressed... Can you tell us the truth?",1,2,0,51,51,,,
02408,Nagito,Trial 2,"Even though you're not the killer, you still went to the beach house, right?",1,2,0,52,52,,,
02409,Nagito,Trial 2,"Yeah, I got that already so... Can you give us the details about that trap?",1,2,0,53,53,,,
02410,Nagito,Trial 2,"The killer forged them so they could manipulate their actions. Yeah, that's how we should think about it.",1,2,0,54,54,,,
02411,Nagito,Trial 2,Really? This is realyl terrible...,1,2,0,55,55,,,
02412,Nagito,Trial 2,I've offered to help so many times but the killer this time didn't discuss their plan with me at all!,1,2,0,56,56,,,
02413,Nagito,Trial 2,It's all my fault! I'm so ashamed of being unreliable!,1,2,0,57,57,,,
02414,Nagito,Trial 2,"You're wrong, Fuyuhiko. We aren't supposed to doubt each other here, we're supposed to work together.",1,2,0,58,58,,,
02415,Nagito,Trial 2,"The class trial is where we cooperate with each other, work hard and aim for victory.",1,2,0,59,59,,,
02416,Nagito,Trial 2,"The killer and everyone else, two hopes attempting to grasp the one true hope!",1,2,0,60,60,,,
02417,Nagito,Trial 2,Two hopes clashing with each other is poetry in motion! That is what a class trial should be!,1,2,0,61,61,,,
02418,Nagito,Trial 2,I'm on the side of the absolute hope that can overcome any despair.,1,2,0,62,62,,,
02419,Nagito,Trial 2,And I believe that absolute hope exists at the point where two hopes clash.,1,2,0,63,63,,,
02420,Nagito,Trial 2,I agree with that as well.,1,2,0,64,64,,,
02421,Nagito,Trial 2,There's no way the killer would leave Hiyoko by herself if they were trying to frame her.,1,2,0,65,65,,,
02422,Nagito,Trial 2,"If Hiyoko was left alone and ruined the evidence the killer had planted, it would've messed up their plan.",1,2,0,66,66,,,
02423,Nagito,Trial 2,"Instead, it makes more sense to think that the killer was hiding in the beach house, watching Hiyoko.",1,2,0,67,67,,,
02424,Nagito,Trial 2,Hmph!,1,2,0,68,68,,,
02425,Nagito,Trial 2,"Sorry Akane, it's not like that.",1,2,0,69,69,,,
02426,Nagito,Trial 2,"Hey Monokuma, can I ask you about something that seems strange to me?",1,2,0,70,70,,,
02427,Nagito,Trial 2,I'll listen to your story about men from the future some other time.,1,2,0,71,71,,,
02428,Nagito,Trial 2,"As I recall, the Body Discovery Announcement is made when three or more people discover a body, right?",1,2,0,72,72,,,
02429,Nagito,Trial 2,Is the killer also included among those three or more people?,1,2,0,73,73,,,
02430,Nagito,Trial 2,You don't sound very articulate...,1,2,0,74,74,,,
02431,Nagito,Trial 2,So you're saying it's unfortunate that I used it for deduction? I understand your excuse but...,1,2,0,75,75,,,
02432,Nagito,Trial 2,"Depending on who actually found the body it's possible that your ""Three or more people"" rule could be deadly.",1,2,0,76,76,,,
02433,Nagito,Trial 2,"Flexibility, huh?",1,2,0,77,77,,,
02434,Nagito,Trial 2,So what about this time? Is it three people including the killer or not?,1,2,0,78,78,,,
02435,Nagito,Trial 2,"Which means, three people other than the killer discovered Mahiru's body.",1,2,0,79,79,,,
02436,Nagito,Trial 2,"Nothing, I just thought it was somewhat strange. More importantly, let's get back to our original topic.",1,2,0,80,80,,,
02437,Nagito,Trial 2,It's going to be alright. If you guys have come this far I'm sure you can disover that answer too.,1,2,0,81,81,,,
02438,Nagito,Trial 2,"Now, let's start the argument, shall we?",1,2,0,82,82,,,
02439,Nagito,Trial 2,What did the killer do with the blood on their body?,1,2,0,83,83,,,
02440,Nagito,Trial 2,It seems you've realized who the killer is...,1,2,0,84,84,,,
02441,Nagito,Trial 2,See? Just as I thought!,1,2,0,85,85,,,
02442,Nagito,Trial 2,I see! Not just the bamboo sword but the sword bag too! She used them both to escape.,1,2,0,86,86,,,
02443,Nagito,Trial 2,Akane said she's like a ninja but it's nothing as silly as that.,1,2,0,87,87,,,
02444,Nagito,Trial 2,"Simply put, only Peko could've performed this feat. An escape plan befitting of the Ultimate Swordswoman!",1,2,0,88,88,,,
02445,Nagito,Trial 2,"Even so, how disappointing. If you'd only let me work with you it would've been an even greater plan...",1,2,0,89,89,,,
02446,Nagito,Trial 2,"If you knew about that incident then you must've played the game, am I right?",1,2,0,90,90,,,
02447,Nagito,Trial 2,"As a serial killer enthusiast you're wondering whether Peko is really Sparkling Justice, am I right?",1,2,0,91,91,,,
02448,Nagito,Trial 2,"Honestly, it felt strange to me too. I mean...",1,2,0,92,92,,,
02449,Nagito,Trial 2,"There's a distinct difference between what we know about Sparkling Justice and Peko, right?",1,2,0,93,93,,,
02450,Nagito,Trial 2,"You know, Sonia described Sparkling Justice like this...",1,2,0,94,94,,,
02451,Nagito,Trial 2,"She called herself a tool, which means someone else used her then?",1,2,0,95,95,,,
02452,Nagito,Trial 2,"I see, I finally understand. Well, I did have a sneaking suspicion all along...",1,2,0,96,96,,,
02453,Nagito,Trial 2,"I mean, besides Peko and Hiyoko someone else was also at the beach house.",1,2,0,97,97,,,
02454,Nagito,Trial 2,There is proof that establishes that fact. Try to remember it.,1,2,0,98,98,,,
02455,Nagito,Trial 2,"Yup, that's right. I mean, didn't Monokuma say so earlier?",1,2,0,99,99,,,
02456,Nagito,Trial 2,That announcement is made when at least three people discover a body.,1,2,0,100,100,,,
02457,Nagito,Trial 2,"And in this particular case the killer, Peko, is not one of those three.",1,2,0,101,101,,,
02458,Nagito,Trial 2,"If that's the case, it would mean only Hiyoko and Kazuichi discovered the body but...",1,2,0,102,102,,,
02459,Nagito,Trial 2,"Plus, the fact that Monokuma tried to hide that truth from us by being flexible with his own rules...",1,2,0,103,103,,,
02460,Nagito,Trial 2,That's such a vital clue that it could alter the outcome of the trial! Like an accomplice for example.,1,2,0,104,104,,,
02461,Nagito,Trial 2,Huh? Am I wrong?,1,2,0,105,105,,,
02462,Nagito,Trial 2,Therefore...,1,2,0,106,106,,,
02463,Nagito,Trial 2,"...that person would have the strongest motive out of everybody else here, right?",1,2,0,107,107,,,
02464,Nagito,Trial 2,If you were shown a photograph of your sister's dead body you'd have no choice but to believe it.,1,2,0,108,108,,,
02465,Nagito,Trial 2,"Even so, you wanted to deny the truth. That's why you sent those photos to Mahiru to confirm it.",1,2,0,109,109,,,
02466,Nagito,Trial 2,I see... That's what you were aiming for all along.,1,2,0,110,110,,,
02467,Nagito,Trial 3,I don't mind starting the trial but I don't really have a grasp of how the case played out.,1,3,0,1,1,,,
02468,Nagito,Trial 3,"Y'know, because I was asleep the whole time.",1,3,0,2,2,,,
02469,Nagito,Trial 3,"Amazing! That's such a heart-pounding story! And then what did you do, Hajime?",1,3,0,3,3,,,
02470,Nagito,Trial 3,Why the motel?,1,3,0,4,4,,,
02471,Nagito,Trial 3,"So that's how the case played out. Thank you, I understood it very easily.",1,3,0,5,5,,,
02472,Nagito,Trial 3,"Wait, how do I know anything Hajime just said is true?",1,3,0,6,6,,,
02473,Nagito,Trial 3,"Sorry, I'm only being impartial right now. And the story I just heard is clearly suspicious.",1,3,0,7,7,,,
02474,Nagito,Trial 3,"Hajime, if you're the only one who saw the hanging video and the first one to discover Ibuki's body...",1,3,0,8,8,,,
02475,Nagito,Trial 3,"...then you could be lying as much as you want right now, right?",1,3,0,9,9,,,
02476,Nagito,Trial 3,"Obviously, so you could make us ignore what might be an inconvenient truth for you.",1,3,0,10,10,,,
02477,Nagito,Trial 3,If you're not lying I would like you to prove it.,1,3,0,11,11,,,
02478,Nagito,Trial 3,"C'mon, try to prove it to me! Prove you're not the killer!",1,3,0,12,12,,,
02479,Nagito,Trial 3,Hajime's testimony is clearly suspicious...,1,3,0,13,13,,,
02480,Nagito,Trial 3,That would also be a lie.,1,3,0,14,14,,,
02481,Nagito,Trial 3,Well obviously because he's the killer!,1,3,0,15,15,,,
02482,Nagito,Trial 3,The fact that the bodies were imitating the movie...,1,3,0,16,16,,,
02483,Nagito,Trial 3,...means it probably is Hajime's fault!,1,3,0,17,17,,,
02484,Nagito,Trial 3,Of course you're not! I already knew that.,1,3,0,18,18,,,
02485,Nagito,Trial 3,Before the incident Hajime had never watched that movie. His invitation ticket is proof of that.,1,3,0,19,19,,,
02486,Nagito,Trial 3,Each person only received one ticket and they're marked with a stamp that shows the date and time.,1,3,0,20,20,,,
02487,Nagito,Trial 3,"Isn't that right, Monokuma?",1,3,0,21,21,,,
02488,Nagito,Trial 3,Which means there's no way Hajime who never saw the movie could commit murders that imitated it.,1,3,0,22,22,,,
02489,Nagito,Trial 3,"Or did anyone tell him what happens in the movie? Of course no one did, right?",1,3,0,23,23,,,
02490,Nagito,Trial 3,"Well, since we're opening with your witness testimony I thougth we should solidify the foundation.",1,3,0,24,24,,,
02491,Nagito,Trial 3,It also provides a good warm-up.,1,3,0,25,25,,,
02492,Nagito,Trial 3,"Heh, don't get mad! I just think warming up is really important, especially since this isn't a game.",1,3,0,26,26,,,
02493,Nagito,Trial 3,"There's another person who doesn't have an alibi. You know, Nekomaru.",1,3,0,27,27,,,
02494,Nagito,Trial 3,If they couldn't have done it while Hajime was away from the venue...,1,3,0,28,28,,,
02495,Nagito,Trial 3,They must've done it earlier than that.,1,3,0,29,29,,,
02496,Nagito,Trial 3,"And when you went back with everyone else Hiyoko's body was there too, right?",1,3,0,30,30,,,
02497,Nagito,Trial 3,But it's possible that the body was just revealed at that time when Hiyoko was actually killed earlier.,1,3,0,31,31,,,
02498,Nagito,Trial 3,"Of course, the body wasn't revealed on its own. The killer did that too.",1,3,0,32,32,,,
02499,Nagito,Trial 3,"Here, I have proof.",1,3,0,33,33,,,
02500,Nagito,Trial 3,"That's right, but... Just what is this scrap anyway?",1,3,0,34,34,,,
02501,Nagito,Trial 3,You're right! If you overlay the scrap that was caught on the lighting with the tear in the wallpaper...,1,3,0,35,35,,,
02502,Nagito,Trial 3,See? It fits perfectly!,1,3,0,36,36,,,
02503,Nagito,Trial 3,A mere nobody like me isn't important enough to answer that.,1,3,0,37,37,,,
02504,Nagito,Trial 3,"But if you guys were exceptional enough to identify that scrap of paper, you can figure this out easily!",1,3,0,38,38,,,
02505,Nagito,Trial 3,"Well that's understandable. I mean, it makes sense that you'd notice Ibuki's body right away.",1,3,0,39,39,,,
02506,Nagito,Trial 3,The baton lighting forms a perfect circle around the pillar. So using it to hang the wallpaper totally fits.,1,3,0,40,40,,,
02507,Nagito,Trial 3,The killer must've been in a hurry. If their plan took too long Hajime could've walked in on them.,1,3,0,41,41,,,
02508,Nagito,Trial 3,But the crime itself would be much easier to pull off since they don't have much to do while Hajime's gone.,1,3,0,42,42,,,
02509,Nagito,Trial 3,They just have to peel off that wallpaper and stash it in the storage room. It's not that big of a deal.,1,3,0,43,43,,,
02510,Nagito,Trial 3,"Good point, and on that note...",1,3,0,44,44,,,
02511,Nagito,Trial 3,...it's about time we shed some time on those imitation murders.,1,3,0,45,45,,,
02512,Nagito,Trial 3,"Based on what we know, the killer chose these imitations isn't that difficult to figure out.",1,3,0,46,46,,,
02513,Nagito,Trial 3,"Ah, wait a sec! There's something I wanna run by Monokuma first.",1,3,0,47,47,,,
02514,Nagito,Trial 3,"Hey, if the victim actually committed suicide, what are we supposed to do?",1,3,0,48,48,,,
02515,Nagito,Trial 3,"Well, I mean, I understand Hiyoko's death but I'm wondering if Ibuki was really murdered...",1,3,0,49,49,,,
02516,Nagito,Trial 3,"For example, it's possible Ibuki killed Hiyoko and then committed suicide due to a guilty conscience, right?",1,3,0,50,50,,,
02517,Nagito,Trial 3,"She was afflicted by the despair disease, remember? That means anything can happen.",1,3,0,51,51,,,
02518,Nagito,Trial 3,Then she was alive!,1,3,0,52,52,,,
02519,Nagito,Trial 3,"When Hajime first discovered Ibuki, she was just pretending to be dead.",1,3,0,53,53,,,
02520,Nagito,Trial 3,"If she waited until Hajime left, that's when she could've made her move and mess with the crime scene.",1,3,0,54,54,,,
02521,Nagito,Trial 3,"Hmm, I see. So that means...",1,3,0,55,55,,,
02522,Nagito,Trial 3,"...there's no doubt that someone killed those two. I'm glad, now I'm free to search for the killer!",1,3,0,56,56,,,
02523,Nagito,Trial 3,"Ah, there's still one more issue on my mind.",1,3,0,57,57,,,
02524,Nagito,Trial 3,"If Ibuki didn't commit suicide, just what was that video Hajime saw?",1,3,0,58,58,,,
02525,Nagito,Trial 3,"According to that video you saw, Ibuki was by herself when she climbed the stepladder, right?",1,3,0,59,59,,,
02526,Nagito,Trial 3,Then does that mean someone forced her to do it?,1,3,0,60,60,,,
02527,Nagito,Trial 3,I don't know anything about that...,1,3,0,61,61,,,
02528,Nagito,Trial 3,"Hmm, so Ibuki hanged herself right before Monokuma's announcement.",1,3,0,62,62,,,
02529,Nagito,Trial 3,And since we established that Hiyoko was killed before Ibuki...,1,3,0,63,63,,,
02530,Nagito,Trial 3,...that means the time that the murders occurred was before and during the announcement!,1,3,0,64,64,,,
02531,Nagito,Trial 3,"We can exclue the sick people like me and Akane, right?",1,3,0,65,65,,,
02532,Nagito,Trial 3,...,1,3,0,66,66,,,
02533,Nagito,Trial 3,"But committing an imitation murder, is that really all it was?",1,3,0,67,67,,,
02534,Nagito,Trial 3,"Faking the time the crime occurred by falsifying the muder sequence, hiding their alibi in the process...",1,3,0,68,68,,,
02535,Nagito,Trial 3,...was that the only reason the killer made both bodies imitate the movie?,1,3,0,69,69,,,
02536,Nagito,Trial 3,I feel really bad for confusing you guys so much but that's how I feel.,1,3,0,70,70,,,
02537,Nagito,Trial 3,I think the killer had a completely different reason for falsifying the murder sequence.,1,3,0,71,71,,,
02538,Nagito,Trial 3,"Huh, it suddenly got quiet in here.",1,3,0,72,72,,,
02539,Nagito,Trial 3,"Did I confuse you? If so, I wish I could die from self loathing.",1,3,0,73,73,,,
02540,Nagito,Trial 3,"If that's the case, it would've been just dandy if they'd gone ahead and killed me too!",1,3,0,74,74,,,
02541,Nagito,Trial 3,If that happened the imitation would've been perfect! So why didn't they do that?,1,3,0,75,75,,,
02542,Nagito,Trial 3,That rule is too harsh! I couldn't get killed because of that...,1,3,0,76,76,,,
02543,Nagito,Trial 3,...,1,3,0,77,77,,,
02544,Nagito,Trial 3,...,1,3,0,78,78,,,
02545,Nagito,Trial 3,...,1,3,0,79,79,,,
02546,Nagito,Trial 3,"Oh, am I allowed to speak?",1,3,0,80,80,,,
02547,Nagito,Trial 3,"Ha, I'm so happy I'm getting goosebumps! Everyone actually needs help from scum like me!",1,3,0,81,81,,,
02548,Nagito,Trial 3,I was thinking about it while I had my mouth shut but now I'm finally able to come to a conclusion.,1,3,0,82,82,,,
02549,Nagito,Trial 3,Ibuki definitely didn't commit suicide!,1,3,0,83,83,,,
02550,Nagito,Trial 3,I thought there might be a way that she faked her death and tampered with the crime scene...,1,3,0,84,84,,,
02551,Nagito,Trial 3,...but now I remember! There was blood on Ibuki's slippers!,1,3,0,85,85,,,
02552,Nagito,Trial 3,So if she faked her death and walked around the music venue tampering with the crime scene...,1,3,0,86,86,,,
02553,Nagito,Trial 3,....there'd be blood footprints left in various places throughout the venue.,1,3,0,87,87,,,
02554,Nagito,Trial 3,So that's why I think there's no way Ibuki faked her death. There's no way Ibuki committed suicide!,1,3,0,88,88,,,
02555,Nagito,Trial 3,"Huh, really?",1,3,0,89,89,,,
02556,Nagito,Trial 3,"That's annoying. I guess I should just awkwardly laugh about it then. Heh, heh, heheh...",1,3,0,90,90,,,
02557,Nagito,Trial 3,Y-you noticed such a small detail! This is truly the talent of a chosen Ultimate!,1,3,0,91,91,,,
02558,Nagito,Trial 3,But that's something only Hajime would know since he's the only one who saw that video.,1,3,0,92,92,,,
02559,Nagito,Trial 3,That is truly strange.,1,3,0,93,93,,,
02560,Nagito,Trial 3,If the video showed the moment of Ibuki's death the Hiyoko should've already been that by that point.,1,3,0,94,94,,,
02561,Nagito,Trial 3,"And there's no way the video was recorded in advance. If that's the case, the only thing I can think of is...",1,3,0,95,95,,,
02562,Nagito,Trial 3,"You're suggesting that the stepladder in the video isn't the only thing that's different, am I right?",1,3,0,96,96,,,
02563,Nagito,Trial 3,"That's amazing, Chiaki! All that gaming has given you incredible deduction skills! Is it okay to say that?",1,3,0,97,97,,,
02564,Nagito,Trial 3,"And the moment Hajime left the music venue, the killer took back the camera they took.",1,3,0,98,98,,,
02565,Nagito,Trial 3,"I see, the conference room. Indeed, the floor of that room is...",1,3,0,99,99,,,
02566,Nagito,Trial 3,...the same color as the music venue stage!,1,3,0,100,100,,,
02567,Nagito,Trial 3,So the killer chose the conference room because they realized the floor matched!,1,3,0,101,101,,,
02568,Nagito,Trial 3,That might've been another reason but... The main reason was probably to tamper with evidence.,1,3,0,102,102,,,
02569,Nagito,Trial 3,"The lighting in the conference room and the music venue are so different, they couldn't be used during filming.",1,3,0,103,103,,,
02570,Nagito,Trial 3,That's why the killer used a candle as film lighting instead.,1,3,0,104,104,,,
02571,Nagito,Trial 3,But this must be a surprising turn of events for Hajime...,1,3,0,105,105,,,
02572,Nagito,Trial 3,You never suspected that the video you saw in the hospital was being filmed in the conference room.,1,3,0,106,106,,,
02573,Nagito,Trial 3,"By that time, the real Ibuki must've already been killed.",1,3,0,107,107,,,
02574,Nagito,Trial 3,"Now that you mention it, you guys brought that up earlier. Only Hajime and Mikan have an alibi.",1,3,0,108,108,,,
02575,Nagito,Trial 3,"Not only that, the others in the hospital, Akane and I, were both delirious from the despair disease.",1,3,0,109,109,,,
02576,Nagito,Trial 3,"It's not literally impossible, can't you give a better defense than that?",1,3,0,110,110,,,
02577,Nagito,Trial 3,"Ah, can you hold on a minute?",1,3,0,111,111,,,
02578,Nagito,Trial 3,"Well, I know I'm being intrusive at all and I mean, I have no place to say this...",1,3,0,112,112,,,
02579,Nagito,Trial 3,I missed all of the critical parts and I doubt I have anything worth saying at an important time like this...,1,3,0,113,113,,,
02580,Nagito,Trial 3,"...but still, there's definitely no way I can overlook the killer this time.",1,3,0,114,114,,,
02581,Nagito,Trial 3,"I thought it was suspicious all along, from the very beginning.",1,3,0,115,115,,,
02582,Nagito,Trial 3,Investigating with a suspect in mind creates a different result than investigating with no leads.,1,3,0,116,116,,,
02583,Nagito,Trial 3,"Well, thanks to that I was able to discover a truth that nobody else knows.",1,3,0,117,117,,,
02584,Nagito,Trial 3,"I've been so focused on everybody else this trial but I guess now's a good time to say it, right?",1,3,0,118,118,,,
02585,Nagito,Trial 3,"Well, it's nothing big really. Only a small, decisive clue that points to the killer.",1,3,0,119,119,,,
02586,Nagito,Trial 3,"Let's take a look, shall we?",1,3,0,120,120,,,
02587,Nagito,Trial 3,Regarding the rope Ibuki was dangling from...,1,3,0,121,121,,,
02588,Nagito,Trial 3,"...this rope was supplied by the supermarket, right? There weren't any ropes inside the music venue.",1,3,0,122,122,,,
02589,Nagito,Trial 3,"If they got it at the supermarket that means it was brand new, right?",1,3,0,123,123,,,
02590,Nagito,Trial 3,"I want you to take a close look at this rope, and keep in mind that it's brand new.",1,3,0,124,124,,,
02591,Nagito,Trial 3,Near the middle of the rope it's frayed as if it was rubbed strongly.,1,3,0,125,125,,,
02592,Nagito,Trial 3,But why is it like this? The loop Ibuki used to hang herself with is on one end of the rope...,1,3,0,126,126,,,
02593,Nagito,Trial 3,...and the part of the rope that hung from the baton lighting is on the other end.,1,3,0,127,127,,,
02594,Nagito,Trial 3,"It means, well, from what I can confer... I think the rope was used like this...",1,3,0,128,128,,,
02595,Nagito,Trial 3,"The killer wrapped the rope around Ibuki's neck, pulled both ends at full strength and strangled her.",1,3,0,129,129,,,
02596,Nagito,Trial 3,The center of the rope is frayed because that's the part they used to strangle Ibuki.,1,3,0,130,130,,,
02597,Nagito,Trial 3,Not everyone cooperates at a class trial. Those who lie and conceal the truth will obviously be here too.,1,3,0,131,131,,,
02598,Nagito,Trial 3,Just like this case's killer! I was  just copying them a little bit.,1,3,0,132,132,,,
02599,Nagito,Trial 3,And then... I finished speaking.,1,3,0,133,133,,,
02600,Nagito,Trial 3,Huh? You didn't notice it? I thought I made the decisive clue very clear.,1,3,0,134,134,,,
02601,Nagito,Trial 3,Ibuki didn't die from hanging.,1,3,0,135,135,,,
02602,Nagito,Trial 3,She was strangled to death.,1,3,0,136,136,,,
02603,Nagito,Trial 3,But we believed it was from hanging...,1,3,0,137,137,,,
02604,Nagito,Trial 3,Why would that be?,1,3,0,138,138,,,
02605,Nagito,Trial 3,You should've been able to tell the difference between hanging and strangling just by looking.,1,3,0,139,139,,,
02606,Nagito,Trial 3,"You, Mikan. The Ultimate Nurse.",1,3,0,140,140,,,
02607,Nagito,Trial 3,But even a drunk medical student can notice the difference between a hanging and strangulation.,1,3,0,141,141,,,
02608,Nagito,Trial 3,Don't you think her devotion to nursing is what helped her draw Ibuki to her death?,1,3,0,142,142,,,
02609,Nagito,Trial 3,"And if not, her symptoms were still very serious and caused her to believe what anybody told her.",1,3,0,143,143,,,
02610,Nagito,Trial 3,It wouldn't surprise me if she willingly followed Mikan because she was nursing her.,1,3,0,144,144,,,
02611,Nagito,Trial 3,"I'm not a criminal, Mikan is! I mean, she's a killer, you know?",1,3,0,145,145,,,
02612,Nagito,Trial 3,I'm sorry but there's no way I can forgive you.,1,3,0,146,146,,,
02613,Nagito,Trial 3,I just can't forgive this crime at all.,1,3,0,147,147,,,
02614,Nagito,Trial 3,Ah...,1,3,0,148,148,,,
02615,Nagito,Trial 3,"Hmm, I see... You guys are kind.",1,3,0,149,149,,,
02616,Nagito,Trial 3,"Well, if that's the choice everyone makes then the only thing I can do is back off, I guess...",1,3,0,150,150,,,
02617,Nagito,Trial 3,But is that really okay? Is that everyone's hope?,1,3,0,151,151,,,
02618,Nagito,Trial 3,"Is acting like this your strategy now? Well, this is annoying...",1,3,0,152,152,,,
02619,Nagito,Trial 3,"Plus, to be honest, I've run out of ideas. How can we get you to admit it, that's the issue.",1,3,0,153,153,,,
02620,Nagito,Trial 3,We can't think of anybody else other than you...,1,3,0,154,154,,,
02621,Nagito,Trial 3,...who could've filmed that video.,1,3,0,155,155,,,
02622,Nagito,Trial 3,The only reason Mikan knew the camera angle Hajime had seen...,1,3,0,156,156,,,
02623,Nagito,Trial 3,...is because you're the person who actually filmed that video! Is that right?,1,3,0,157,157,,,
02624,Nagito,Trial 3,Taking your stubborness this far... Such despair...,1,3,0,158,158,,,
02625,Nagito,Trial 3,It seems her desperate struggle is finall coming to an end.,1,3,0,159,159,,,
02626,Nagito,Trial 4,Huh? ,1,4,0,1,1,,,
02627,Nagito,Trial 4,Huh?,1,4,0,2,2,,,
02628,Nagito,Trial 4,"But we can't say for sure that that instinct is wrong, can we?",1,4,0,3,3,,,
02629,Nagito,Trial 4,There's another way to use that pillar to kill. You guys just haven't noticed it.,1,4,0,4,4,,,
02630,Nagito,Trial 4,*Sigh*,1,4,0,5,5,,,
02631,Nagito,Trial 4,You guys... The same as usual...,1,4,0,6,6,,,
02632,Nagito,Trial 4,"You're unable to clear a path to the future with your own powers, so you jsut stand there and falter.",1,4,0,7,7,,,
02633,Nagito,Trial 4,What a waste of talent! And you all intend to fight the future foundation? You make me laugh!,1,4,0,8,8,,,
02634,Nagito,Trial 4,"Regardless, it's not like I wanna die with the rest of you. So I guess I should lend a hand.",1,4,0,9,9,,,
02635,Nagito,Trial 4,I've learned a valuable lesson: Ignorance is by far the greatest shame.,1,4,0,10,10,,,
02636,Nagito,Trial 4,"Well, first of all, the pillar itself is not enough.",1,4,0,11,11,,,
02637,Nagito,Trial 4,"But when combined with a specific item, there's a way it could be possible.",1,4,0,12,12,,,
02638,Nagito,Trial 4,"Of course, the Ultimate Weapon.",1,4,0,13,13,,,
02639,Nagito,Trial 4,"Of course I know! But I'm pretty sure everyone else has seen it, y'know?",1,4,0,14,14,,,
02640,Nagito,Trial 4,"In order to clarify that, we first need to solve the secret of the Funhouse.",1,4,0,15,15,,,
02641,Nagito,Trial 4,"You still don't realize it? Jeez, get it together! You're supposed to be the symbols of hope, aren't you?",1,4,0,16,16,,,
02642,Nagito,Trial 4,"Ah, I forgot. Except for Hajime of course.",1,4,0,17,17,,,
02643,Nagito,Trial 4,If so then what? Do you seriously such a simple answer is the correct answer?,1,4,0,18,18,,,
02644,Nagito,Trial 4,"Oops, I guess I've said too much.",1,4,0,19,19,,,
02645,Nagito,Trial 4,I thought it would come to this. *Sigh* I knew my turn was coming up.,1,4,0,20,20,,,
02646,Nagito,Trial 4,"Fine, I'll tell you guys a big hint that can tell you guys the secret of the Funhouse.",1,4,0,21,21,,,
02647,Nagito,Trial 4,But then it wouldn't mean anything! I need you guys to do this class trial properly.,1,4,0,22,22,,,
02648,Nagito,Trial 4,It's also for me because it will help me... determine something.,1,4,0,23,23,,,
02649,Nagito,Trial 4,I have a good reason for that.,1,4,0,24,24,,,
02650,Nagito,Trial 4,The reason I'm the only one who knows it is because I'm the only one who performed the appropriate action.,1,4,0,25,25,,,
02651,Nagito,Trial 4,"That's right, the hint is what I saw after I cleared it.",1,4,0,26,26,,,
02652,Nagito,Trial 4,In the depths of the Final Dead Room there was a hidden room surrounded by concrete.,1,4,0,27,27,,,
02653,Nagito,Trial 4,"And there, a small conspicuous window waited all by itself.",1,4,0,28,28,,,
02654,Nagito,Trial 4,From that window I saw some very strange scenery.,1,4,0,29,29,,,
02655,Nagito,Trial 4,"Instead of explaining it, it might be faster just to show you.",1,4,0,30,30,,,
02656,Nagito,Trial 4,"At an opportune time, I found a perfect camera in the Final Dead Room.",1,4,0,31,31,,,
02657,Nagito,Trial 4,Yup.,1,4,0,32,32,,,
02658,Nagito,Trial 4,See? This is it.,1,4,0,33,33,,,
02659,Nagito,Trial 4,Let me explain it to you again...,1,4,0,34,34,,,
02660,Nagito,Trial 4,I took this picture on the first floor of Strawberry House from the secret room within the Final Dead Room.,1,4,0,35,35,,,
02661,Nagito,Trial 4,But don't you think it's weird?,1,4,0,36,36,,,
02662,Nagito,Trial 4,If the Funhouse's structure is what you guys have been thinking...,1,4,0,37,37,,,
02663,Nagito,Trial 4,"...then there's lots of things that don't make sense in this picture, right?",1,4,0,38,38,,,
02664,Nagito,Trial 4,"Then let's begin! Shall I call it ""thinking time""?",1,4,0,39,39,,,
02665,Nagito,Trial 4,"Yeah, it should've been.",1,4,0,40,40,,,
02666,Nagito,Trial 4,I see... And is that it?,1,4,0,41,41,,,
02667,Nagito,Trial 4,"That's right, good call.",1,4,0,42,42,,,
02668,Nagito,Trial 4,"In summary, this is the truth contained in this photo...",1,4,0,43,43,,,
02669,Nagito,Trial 4,The first floor of Strawberry House is located in a high area and Grape House is not behind the tower.,1,4,0,44,44,,,
02670,Nagito,Trial 4,"From this point on, do your own thinking. Now that you finally met the same requirements as me...",1,4,0,45,45,,,
02671,Nagito,Trial 4,If you guys are truly symbols of hope you can easily solve a simple mystery like this.,1,4,0,46,46,,,
02672,Nagito,Trial 4,"It might be possible for Hajime to solve it too, even though he's just a normal high school student.",1,4,0,47,47,,,
02673,Nagito,Trial 4,Despite the fact that you don't have a real talent you already know about the other clue.,1,4,0,48,48,,,
02674,Nagito,Trial 4,"I'm asking you just to be safe. At the time, where do you think I came from?",1,4,0,49,49,,,
02675,Nagito,Trial 4,Such sharp eyes! So you realized it already.,1,4,0,50,50,,,
02676,Nagito,Trial 4,What does it mean?,1,4,0,51,51,,,
02677,Nagito,Trial 4,"Then let me hear it, what kind of answer will you give, I wonder...",1,4,0,52,52,,,
02678,Nagito,Trial 4,In order to conceal the unique design of the funhouse...,1,4,0,53,53,,,
02679,Nagito,Trial 4,...Monokuma put us to sleep so we couldn't look at the outside of the building when he brought us to it.,1,4,0,54,54,,,
02680,Nagito,Trial 4,It was... probably wrapped there by the killer to keep us as far fro Strawberry Tower as possible.,1,4,0,55,55,,,
02681,Nagito,Trial 4,"Because of that chain you guys thought that you couldn't enter there, right?",1,4,0,56,56,,,
02682,Nagito,Trial 4,The killer destroyed the Strawberry Hall button so we'd stay away from Strawberr Tower.,1,4,0,57,57,,,
02683,Nagito,Trial 4,Everything was done to tamper with the evidence so we wouldn't find out about the secret of the Funhouse.,1,4,0,58,58,,,
02684,Nagito,Trial 4,The appearance of a body in the tower would contradict what we thought we knew about the building.,1,4,0,59,59,,,
02685,Nagito,Trial 4,"In that situation, if we'd gone to Strawberry Tower we'd have seen that contradiction firsthand.",1,4,0,60,60,,,
02686,Nagito,Trial 4,"And using that as a clue, we might've discovered the truth...",1,4,0,61,61,,,
02687,Nagito,Trial 4,...the truth that the two houses and the two towers are actually one complete vertical building.,1,4,0,62,62,,,
02688,Nagito,Trial 4,The killer wanted to keep us from learning that. That's why they made us stay way from Strawberry Tower.,1,4,0,63,63,,,
02689,Nagito,Trial 4,It would've been a major inconvenience.,1,4,0,64,64,,,
02690,Nagito,Trial 4,"After all, this Funhouse is strongly connected to the Ultimate Weapon that killed Nekomaru.",1,4,0,65,65,,,
02691,Nagito,Trial 4,"Huh? You still don't know what the Ultimate Weapon is yet? It's what I found at the Octagon, you know?",1,4,0,66,66,,,
02692,Nagito,Trial 4,Oh my... I can't believe I have to explain that now.,1,4,0,67,67,,,
02693,Nagito,Trial 4,"As long as you know what an octagon means, you can solve this simple mystery easily.",1,4,0,68,68,,,
02694,Nagito,Trial 4,I didn't expect you to know that! For a substitute Reserve Course student you're quite knowledgeable!,1,4,0,69,69,,,
02695,Nagito,Trial 4,"I guess I should continue listening... Where is the place befitting of the name ""octagon""?",1,4,0,70,70,,,
02696,Nagito,Trial 4,That's basically the gist of it.,1,4,0,71,71,,,
02697,Nagito,Trial 4,The true identity of the Octagon is that secret room in the depths of the Final Dead Room.,1,4,0,72,72,,,
02698,Nagito,Trial 4,"In actuality, that place contained various weapons.",1,4,0,73,73,,,
02699,Nagito,Trial 4,That's a little different. I learned the true identity of the Ultimate Weapon at the Octagon.,1,4,0,74,74,,,
02700,Nagito,Trial 4,The true identity of the Ultimate Weapon is the Funhouse...,1,4,0,75,75,,,
02701,Nagito,Trial 4,"...which means, the killer used the building's structure as their weapon and killed Nekomaru!",1,4,0,76,76,,,
02702,Nagito,Trial 4,"Like me, the killer probably realized the secret of the Funhouse from the scenery...",1,4,0,77,77,,,
02703,Nagito,Trial 4,...and then thought of a way to kill making use of the building structure.,1,4,0,78,78,,,
02704,Nagito,Trial 4,That's why the killer tried to keep us from learning the mystery of the building!,1,4,0,79,79,,,
02705,Nagito,Trial 4,"But more importantly, using the builing itself as a weapon? Such a spectacular crime!",1,4,0,80,80,,,
02706,Nagito,Trial 4,Gahahahahaha! It truly deserves to be called the Ultimate Weapon!,1,4,0,81,81,,,
02707,Nagito,Trial 4,There's no way I'd lie at such an important moment! I don't wanna die either...,1,4,0,82,82,,,
02708,Nagito,Trial 4,"He's right, there was a time I thought I could become a stepping stone for your hopes but...",1,4,0,83,83,,,
02709,Nagito,Trial 4,...I will sincerely retract that remark.,1,4,0,84,84,,,
02710,Nagito,Trial 4,"I'm disappointed too, you know? If this was a murder for the sake of hope, I'd happily sacrifice myself.",1,4,0,85,85,,,
02711,Nagito,Trial 4,I see.,1,4,0,86,86,,,
02712,Nagito,Trial 4,So you're telling us all...,1,4,0,87,87,,,
02713,Nagito,Trial 4,"...to think about the arrangement, right?",1,4,0,88,88,,,
02714,Nagito,Trial 4,"And then, in order to make him fall from the force he was generating...",1,4,0,89,89,,,
02715,Nagito,Trial 4,...the wire was hung on the tip of the doorknob so it would easily slip off!,1,4,0,90,90,,,
02716,Nagito,Trial 4,"In actuality, the scrapemarks caused by the wire were near the tip of the doorknob, right?",1,4,0,91,91,,,
02717,Nagito,Trial 4,"When Nekomaru awoke he must've struggled much more than expected, which caused the doorknob to break off.",1,4,0,92,92,,,
02718,Nagito,Trial 4,"So thanks to that alarm, Nekomaru ended up falling while he was still hanging upside down!",1,4,0,93,93,,,
02719,Nagito,Trial 4,"That doesn't mean he just crashed straight into the floor. Of course, you know that too, right?",1,4,0,94,94,,,
02720,Nagito,Trial 4,"Well, the pillar was a bonus. It's not even clear if the killer intended that or if it was just a coincidence.",1,4,0,95,95,,,
02721,Nagito,Trial 4,"Oh, that's what I asked you to do! So you really listened to me and check all the clocks...",1,4,0,96,96,,,
02722,Nagito,Trial 4,I see... So the killer messed with the time inside the whole building by changing all the clocks!,1,4,0,97,97,,,
02723,Nagito,Trial 4,This is truly fantastic!,1,4,0,98,98,,,
02724,Nagito,Trial 4,Or his scream.,1,4,0,99,99,,,
02725,Nagito,Trial 4,"If we used that rumbling sound as a reference, we might be able to figure out how much our time was off.",1,4,0,100,100,,,
02726,Nagito,Trial 4,"The reason is obvious, so that they could lure out just Nekomaru.",1,4,0,101,101,,,
02727,Nagito,Trial 4,"If you messed with the clocks and used a specific thing, you'd definitely get Nekomaru to the tower alone, right?",1,4,0,102,102,,,
02728,Nagito,Trial 4,"From there, the killer's plan was a splending success. That's all it means.",1,4,0,103,103,,,
02729,Nagito,Trial 4,"We were required to go to Grape Tower every morning at 7 AM for that activity, right?",1,4,0,104,104,,,
02730,Nagito,Trial 4,"But if they messed with all the clocks inside the building, what would that do to us?",1,4,0,105,105,,,
02731,Nagito,Trial 4,"That's right, in doing so the killer was able to lure him to the tower byhimself at the precise time.",1,4,0,106,106,,,
02732,Nagito,Trial 4,"If I recall, you witnessed Nekomaru around 5 AM.",1,4,0,107,107,,,
02733,Nagito,Trial 4,"And if that time was also two hours off, it should've been 7 AM. Yeah, that's pretty much it.",1,4,0,108,108,,,
02734,Nagito,Trial 4,"At that time, he was heading over to Monokuma Tai Chi, right on schedule.",1,4,0,109,109,,,
02735,Nagito,Trial 4,Let's just ignore the peanut gallery. Now that we figure out how the killer lured Nekomaru...,1,4,0,110,110,,,
02736,Nagito,Trial 4,...the number of suspects has drastically decreased.,1,4,0,111,111,,,
02737,Nagito,Trial 4,You'll know I'm not lying when you listen to what Fuyuhiko's going to say next.,1,4,0,112,112,,,
02738,Nagito,Trial 4,You witnessed Nekomaru going toward the tower. Did something else happen after that?,1,4,0,113,113,,,
02739,Nagito,Trial 4,...,1,4,0,114,114,,,
02740,Nagito,Trial 4,...,1,4,0,115,115,,,
02741,Nagito,Trial 4,...,1,4,0,116,116,,,
02742,Nagito,Trial 4,If I may be frank...,1,4,0,117,117,,,
02743,Nagito,Trial 4,"...even if I wanted to go to the lounge, I couldn't.",1,4,0,118,118,,,
02744,Nagito,Trial 4,"Not only did I not hear the alarm, I never even heard that rumbling sound.",1,4,0,119,119,,,
02745,Nagito,Trial 4,You still don't know?,1,4,0,120,120,,,
02746,Nagito,Trial 4,Think about what the three of us who didn't hear a sound have in common and I'm sure you'll figure it out.,1,4,0,121,121,,,
02747,Nagito,Trial 4,"That's right, it was because the Deluxe Rooms have superior sound isolation.",1,4,0,122,122,,,
02748,Nagito,Trial 4,"You actually noticed that! Nice catch, Hajime! Are you using your Ultimate Reserve Course Student talent?",1,4,0,123,123,,,
02749,Nagito,Trial 4,"Now then, you guys must understand by now, right? The true identity of Nekomaru's killer...",1,4,0,124,124,,,
02750,Nagito,Trial 4,"Wh-why? Well, that fact just now was a very important clue and a decisive factor in identifying the killer!",1,4,0,125,125,,,
02751,Nagito,Trial 4,Gundham probably couldn't return to his room because of Fuyuhiko.,1,4,0,126,126,,,
02752,Nagito,Trial 4,"After you saw Nekomaru heading to the tower, you stayed at the lounge for a while. Am I correct?",1,4,0,127,127,,,
02753,Nagito,Trial 4,"Until the moment that alarm stared ringing, right?",1,4,0,128,128,,,
02754,Nagito,Trial 4,"If you were in the lounge for that long, the killer who had left earlier obviously wouldn't be able to go back. ",1,4,0,129,129,,,
02755,Nagito,Trial 4,"In their original plan, the killer should've returned to their room before the alarm in the lounge went off.",1,4,0,130,130,,,
02756,Nagito,Trial 4,"And, they were supposed to stay in their room. They weren't planning to come out and go to the lounge.",1,4,0,131,131,,,
02757,Nagito,Trial 4,The best-case scenario would've been if those two in the lounge had gone to check the Deluxe Rooms.,1,4,0,132,132,,,
02758,Nagito,Trial 4,"After all, if they personally saw the killer sleeping in their room it gives the killer a stronger alibi.",1,4,0,133,133,,,
02759,Nagito,Trial 4,"Unfortunately, they failed to secure that alibi.",1,4,0,134,134,,,
02760,Nagito,Trial 4,So the killer couldn't go back to their room and ended up hearing the lounge's alarm.,1,4,0,135,135,,,
02761,Nagito,Trial 4,"If those two had just checked the Deluxe Rooms as planned that would've been ideal, but...",1,4,0,136,136,,,
02762,Nagito,Trial 4,"How ironic! The moment Fuyuhiko set foot in the lounge, your plan was doomed!",1,4,0,137,137,,,
02763,Nagito,Trial 4,"I see, you're still holding out...",1,4,0,138,138,,,
02764,Nagito,Trial 4,"Well, you don't have to admit it. We're going to decide who the killer is with a majority vote anyway.",1,4,0,139,139,,,
02765,Nagito,Trial 4,"So, why don't we just go ahead and start voting? It's obvious that Gundham is the killer.",1,4,0,140,140,,,
02766,Nagito,Trial 4,"You know, Hajime...",1,4,0,141,141,,,
02767,Nagito,Trial 4,"...this class trial, this killing... It's merely the opening act, you know?",1,4,0,142,142,,,
02768,Nagito,Trial 4,Perhaps I should say... It's just a farce?,1,4,0,143,143,,,
02769,Nagito,Trial 4,"Just a boring farce. So boring, so stressful. I'm so painfully bored that I might develop stomach ulcers.",1,4,0,144,144,,,
02770,Nagito,Trial 4,Seriously! Let's just hurry up and finish this before I collapse from poor health.,1,4,0,145,145,,,
02771,Nagito,Trial 4,Hmm?,1,4,0,146,146,,,
02772,Nagito,Trial 4,Gh-!,1,4,0,147,147,,,
02773,Nagito,Trial 4,"Well, let's just leave that fun for later and finish this opening act already.",1,4,0,148,148,,,
02774,Nagito,Trial 4,But he's completely shut up! Perhaps he can't argue anymore...,1,4,0,149,149,,,
02775,Nagito,Trial 4,Huh? What are you talking about?,1,4,0,150,150,,,
02776,Nagito,Trial 4,...,1,4,0,151,151,,,
02777,Nagito,Trial 4,"Jeez, once again I let the Reserve Course show off...",1,4,0,152,152,,,
02778,Nagito,Trial 4,But you're right. There's a door on the floor of the Octagon which is on the first floor of Strawberry House.,1,4,0,153,153,,,
02779,Nagito,Trial 4,After I opened the door and went down...,1,4,0,154,154,,,
02780,Nagito,Trial 4,"...surprise, surprise! I ended up in the Monokuma archive which is on the third floor of Grape House.",1,4,0,155,155,,,
02781,Nagito,Trial 4,"Plus, once you've cleared the Final Dead Room once you can pass through it as many times as you want.",1,4,0,156,156,,,
02782,Nagito,Trial 4,The only place I can think of is the Octagon.,1,4,0,157,157,,,
02783,Nagito,Trial 4,"There were various weapons and tools there. I'm pretty sure I saw stuff like wires, hammers and chains too.",1,4,0,158,158,,,
02784,Nagito,Trial 4,"It seems, this is the end.",1,4,0,159,159,,,
02785,Nagito,Trial 4,Normally we'd end up listening to Hajime lecture us with a veeery long summary of the case...,1,4,0,160,160,,,
02786,Nagito,Trial 4,"...but there's no reason to waste anymore time on this opening act, so I'm going to end this right now.",1,4,0,161,161,,,
02787,Nagito,Trial 4,"First of all, by messing with all the clocks in the building, Gundham tried to only lure Nekomaru.",1,4,0,162,162,,,
02788,Nagito,Trial 4,The elevator was probably broken by that point.,1,4,0,163,163,,,
02789,Nagito,Trial 4,"Thanks to that, Nekomaru wasn't able to go to Grape Tower which was supposed to be the meet-up point.",1,4,0,164,164,,,
02790,Nagito,Trial 4,So he tried going over to Strawberry Tower...,1,4,0,165,165,,,
02791,Nagito,Trial 4,...just like we did when we found out the elevator was broken.,1,4,0,166,166,,,
02792,Nagito,Trial 4,"Well, it's obvious he'd attempt that. At that time, we didn't know the two towers were the exact same place.",1,4,0,167,167,,,
02793,Nagito,Trial 4,"Also, the button in Strawberry Hall wasn't broken so he was easily able to enter Strawberry Tower.",1,4,0,168,168,,,
02794,Nagito,Trial 4,But surprise! Gundham was waiting for Nekomaru's arrival.,1,4,0,169,169,,,
02795,Nagito,Trial 4,"Their plan was a balancing act of uncertainties but even if they failed, they probably wouldn't have minded.",1,4,0,170,170,,,
02796,Nagito,Trial 4,"They can just greet everyone the next morning as if nothing happened, and come up with a different plan.",1,4,0,171,171,,,
02797,Nagito,Trial 4,"I'm going to continue summarizing the case, okay?",1,4,0,172,172,,,
02798,Nagito,Trial 4,"Through this, Gundham successfully lured Nekomaru to Strawberry Tower.",1,4,0,173,173,,,
02799,Nagito,Trial 4,"There's no way, he could fight head-on with the robotic Nekomaru.",1,4,0,174,174,,,
02800,Nagito,Trial 4,"So by pressing the good night button, he rendered Nekomaru powerless without fighting him.",1,4,0,175,175,,,
02801,Nagito,Trial 4,Hmm? What's wrong with that?,1,4,0,176,176,,,
02802,Nagito,Trial 4,...,1,4,0,177,177,,,
02803,Nagito,Trial 4,Why are you angry all of a sudden?,1,4,0,178,178,,,
02804,Nagito,Trial 6,"And with this, the world will continue to loop!",1,6,0,1,1,,,
02805,Nagito,Game,I'm Nagito Komaeda. Nice to meet you!,1,99,0,1,1,,,

03067,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,There's a shower room inside the beach house!,7,2,0,44,44,,,

03069,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,...she just washed it off in the shower!,7,2,0,46,46,,,
03070,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,The fact that Hiyoko was at the beach house...,7,2,0,47,47,,,

03073,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,O-out of order?,7,2,0,50,50,,,

03083,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,"They couldn't use the shower, right?",7,2,0,60,60,,,
03084,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,So washing it off would've been impossible.,7,2,0,61,61,,,

03102,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,"And what happened to the rope after they used it? And don't say something stupid like ""they threw it outside""!",7,2,0,79,79,,,
03103,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,You see? There's no way they'd be able to escape from that window.,7,2,0,80,80,,,
03104,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,"H-hold on a sec, you bastard!",7,2,0,81,81,,,
03105,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,You're saying she used her sword as a stepstool and went out the fucking window? Then what about the sword?,7,2,0,82,82,,,
03106,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,"It would've been left in the shower room and she wouldn't have been able to recover it, dumbass.",7,2,0,83,83,,,
03107,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,"Gh, shut up! Just shut the fuck up and answer me! If you have an answer then fucking give it to me!",7,2,0,84,84,,,
03108,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,If she used the bamboo sword as a stepstool it would've been left behind!,7,2,0,85,85,,,
03109,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,Guhhh!,7,2,0,86,86,,,
03110,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,"Ah-! Hold on, you're just making assumptions!",7,2,0,87,87,,,
03111,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,Y-you don't have any proof! I won't accept this unless there's proof!,7,2,0,88,88,,,
03112,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,"Got it, you bastard?",7,2,0,89,89,,,
03113,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,Huh?,7,2,0,90,90,,,
03114,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,"I-it's fine, just stop it!",7,2,0,91,91,,,
03115,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,Gh-! I'm telling you to stop it!,7,2,0,92,92,,,
03116,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,...,7,2,0,93,93,,,
03117,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,...,7,2,0,94,94,,,
03118,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,Tch!,7,2,0,95,95,,,
03119,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,...,7,2,0,96,96,,,
03120,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,...,7,2,0,97,97,,,
03121,Fuyuhiko,Trial 2,Just... me?,7,2,0,98,98,,,
03122,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Spending the night at the hospital was prohibited so Hajime and I had to sleep in our cottages.,7,3,0,1,1,,,
03123,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,We were also looking for Ibuki since she disappeared from our sight.,7,3,0,2,2,,,
03124,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Don't say it like that and confuse people!,7,3,0,3,3,,,
03125,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"But the door wouldn't open. Since we had no other option, the four of us broke down the door.",7,3,0,4,4,,,
03126,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"And when that happened, we didn't just find Ibuki's body. We also found Hiyoko's.",7,3,0,5,5,,,
03127,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"And not just that, her body was taped to a pillar.",7,3,0,6,6,,,
03128,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"Well it's clear what the problem to this case is! When Hajime left the music venue, who-?",7,3,0,7,7,,,
03129,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"Like I said before, it's pretty clear what the problem with this case is.",7,3,0,8,8,,,
03130,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,The killer murdered Hiyoko while Hajime was gone...,7,3,0,9,9,,,
03131,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,...so all we gotta do is establish who could've possibly done that!,7,3,0,10,10,,,
03132,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,That's why the killer stalled for time by making the music venue a closed room!,7,3,0,11,11,,,
03133,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,The killer blocked the venue door from the inside to try and keep us from entering right away.,7,3,0,12,12,,,
03134,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"Yeah, you're absolutely right.",7,3,0,13,13,,,
03135,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"Which means, when we broke down the venue door the killer was still inside.",7,3,0,14,14,,,
03136,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"If that's the case, the only suspicious people are those who don't have an alibi for that time.",7,3,0,15,15,,,
03137,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"And that's you two, Sonia and Kazuichi!",7,3,0,16,16,,,
03138,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,The others all have alibis.,7,3,0,17,17,,,
03139,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"Chiaki, Mikan, Hajime and I all broke down the venue door together.",7,3,0,18,18,,,
03140,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Gundham met up with Hajime at the motel right before that.,7,3,0,19,19,,,
03141,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"And if Akane and Nagito were laid up at the hospital, the only person that leaves is one of you.",7,3,0,20,20,,,
03142,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"Anyway, if the killer was hiding inside the venue we should obviously doubt the people who don't have alibis.",7,3,0,21,21,,,
03143,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,The killer was still inside the music venue!,7,3,0,22,22,,,
03144,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,By locking the door from the inside...,7,3,0,23,23,,,
03145,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,...they tried to keep us from getting in!,7,3,0,24,24,,,
03146,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,The lock was on the floor in front of the door.,7,3,0,25,25,,,
03147,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,You can use that as a bolt to lock the door.,7,3,0,26,26,,,
03148,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"By doing that, the killer who was hiding inside...",7,3,0,27,27,,,
03149,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,...waited til we gather together...,7,3,0,28,28,,,
03150,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,...and suddenly appeared!,7,3,0,29,29,,,
03151,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,From the outside? How?,7,3,0,30,30,,,
03152,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"Semi-transparent glob? Like rubber, maybe?",7,3,0,31,31,,,
03153,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Glue?,7,3,0,32,32,,,
03154,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Wh-what'd you say?,7,3,0,33,33,,,
03155,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Are you saying the drumstick was a trap the killer set on purpose?,7,3,0,34,34,,,
03156,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Then I... I totally fell for that fucking trap!,7,3,0,35,35,,,
03157,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"But when Hajime got to the venue only Ibuki's body was there, right?",7,3,0,36,36,,,
03158,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Then... when was Hiyoko actually killed?,7,3,0,37,37,,,
03159,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Ibuki's death by hanging matches the scarecrow's death from the movie.,7,3,0,38,38,,,
03160,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Not just that but Hiyoko getting taped up after her death matches the lion's death!,7,3,0,39,39,,,
03161,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Then... Hiyoko was actually killed before Ibuki?,7,3,0,40,40,,,
03162,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Did you see her walking?,7,3,0,41,41,,,
03163,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"Hiyoko's only wound was a fatal slice on her neck. And she died almost instantly, right?",7,3,0,42,42,,,
03164,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"The reason they wiped off the blood on the floor was so we'd mix up the order of the murders, right?",7,3,0,43,43,,,
03165,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Even if they're able to hide Hiyoko's body it'd be bad if her blood was left out in the open!,7,3,0,44,44,,,
03166,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"Sh-she hanged herself, remember? There's no fucking way she could've faked that!",7,3,0,45,45,,,
03167,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,So everyone who stayed at the hotel doesn't have an alibi.,7,3,0,46,46,,,
03168,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"I was where I was supposed to be, my own cottage.",7,3,0,47,47,,,
03169,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"If that's the case, the killer must be someone else.",7,3,0,48,48,,,
03170,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,But if we never realized it was a half-assed imitation their entire plan would've been completely useless!,7,3,0,49,49,,,
03171,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Maybe the killer summoned her!,7,3,0,50,50,,,
03172,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,If no one called for her then why did she go?,7,3,0,51,51,,,
03173,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"Even if the killer couldn't predict it, why did Hiyoko get killed in the music venue?",7,3,0,52,52,,,
03174,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,She was killed so there wouldn't be any loose ends?,7,3,0,53,53,,,
03175,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,...killed Hiyoko!,7,3,0,54,54,,,
03176,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"Y'know, we already finished talking about that a while ago?",7,3,0,55,55,,,
03177,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"Wait, a-are you saying there were two step ladders?",7,3,0,56,56,,,
03178,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Then... only the monitor was left in the music venue?,7,3,0,57,57,,,
03179,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Which means... Are you saying the candle in the music venue wasn't actually used?,7,3,0,58,58,,,
03180,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,No. T-that's not possible.,7,3,0,59,59,,,
03181,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Right after Hajime saw that video he discovered Ibuki's body at the music venue!,7,3,0,60,60,,,
03182,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,If they took Ibuki from the music venue to the hospital to kill her there's no way it happened during the day!,7,3,0,61,61,,,
03183,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,So it's impossible that someone who wasn't already at the hospital went to the conference room to film.,7,3,0,62,62,,,
03184,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"You better not have kept quiet on purpose! This isn't a game, you know?",7,3,0,63,63,,,
03185,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Wh-what's wrong with that?,7,3,0,64,64,,,
03186,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"The body at the crime scene was hanged, y'know?",7,3,0,65,65,,,
03187,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Obviously we'd assume it was a hanging!,7,3,0,66,66,,,
03188,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,I'm not taking her side or anything but being clumsy and unskilled in this area could lead to a mistake.,7,3,0,67,67,,,
03189,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,That's a little... Aren't you like the thief who suspects everyone else of being thieves?,7,3,0,68,68,,,
03190,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"Eh-eh... H-hey, Mikan!",7,3,0,69,69,,,
03191,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,I-uh... Is this broad really okay? She's emotionally unstable!,7,3,0,70,70,,,
03192,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,Ibuki and Mikan clearly have different body types!,7,3,0,71,71,,,
03193,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,How do you know so much about that video?,7,3,0,72,72,,,
03194,Fuyuhiko,Trial 3,"Hey, why don't we try going over the incident?",7,3,0,73,73,,,
03195,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,We weren't able to leave Strawberry House so I wanna make sure we get a detailed understanding.,7,4,0,1,1,,,
03196,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,"We heard the Body Discovery Announcement too, from Strawberry House obviously.",7,4,0,2,2,,,
03197,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,"As I recall, we found out the elevator was out of order which left us stuck.",7,4,0,3,3,,,
03198,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,I guess we should figure out the weapon first.,7,4,0,4,4,,,
03199,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,"But the hammer was clean, so that's why you can't accept that it's the murder weapon!",7,4,0,5,5,,,
03200,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Then why bother cleaning the oil? If they didn't want it to look suspicious they would've discarded the hammer,7,4,0,6,6,,,
03201,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,B-baby Gangster? Me?,7,4,0,7,7,,,
03202,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,That's the problem! There wasn't anything else at the crime scene that looked like a potential weapon.,7,4,0,8,8,,,
03203,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Huh? Who are you talking about?,7,4,0,9,9,,,
03204,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,"So... He lifted the pillar, and then what? Did he use it to beat himself?",7,4,0,10,10,,,
03205,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,But that's a problem. If it's not the pillar then there's no other weapon we can think of!,7,4,0,11,11,,,
03206,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Considering the pillar's weight...,7,4,0,12,12,,,
03207,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,...it probably exerted a ton of force.,7,4,0,13,13,,,
03208,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Why are you so certain about that?,7,4,0,14,14,,,
03209,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,"Hey, Nagito. What the hell happened to you?",7,4,0,15,15,,,
03210,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,How come you're not talking like a lunatic anymore?,7,4,0,16,16,,,
03211,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Huh? What do you mean?,7,4,0,17,17,,,
03212,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,"Cut the bullshit and say it clearly. What is the ""Ultimate Weapon""?",7,4,0,18,18,,,
03213,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Except for Hajime?,7,4,0,19,19,,,
03214,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,So that's the secret of the Funhouse.,7,4,0,20,20,,,
03215,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Does that mean he's wrong?,7,4,0,21,21,,,
03216,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Then it's impossible to think it was moved.,7,4,0,22,22,,,
03217,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,"Tch, no idea huh?",7,4,0,23,23,,,
03218,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,"Then, the two houses aren't two different three-story buildings...",7,4,0,24,24,,,
03219,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,...they're actually one six-story building?,7,4,0,25,25,,,
03220,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Then what about the towers? Are they arranged vertically just like the houses?,7,4,0,26,26,,,
03221,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,"Then hurry up, dumbass!",7,4,0,27,27,,,
03222,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,So which one was the fake body?,7,4,0,28,28,,,
03223,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,The reason Nekomaru's body was in both towers even though it was supposed to be on different floors...,7,4,0,29,29,,,
03224,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,So that's why we could only enter it from one side or ther other!,7,4,0,30,30,,,
03225,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Not just that but... If I remember correctly even the door knob was broken off.,7,4,0,31,31,,,
03226,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,They destroyed the button and wrapped a chain around the door just for that?,7,4,0,32,32,,,
03227,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,An elevator that rotates while it moves... Is that even possible? It's like something from an amusement park!,7,4,0,33,33,,,
03228,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,What is the... Octagon? I haven't heard about that yet.,7,4,0,34,34,,,
03229,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Why is that place the Octagon?,7,4,0,35,35,,,
03230,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,What happened to the bastard who kept saying how much they didn't mind dying?,7,4,0,36,36,,,
03231,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Did you forget how the elevator functions? When it's on the first floor the door on the fourth flor won't open!,7,4,0,37,37,,,
03232,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,It'd be impossible to shove off the victim from up there!,7,4,0,38,38,,,
03233,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,I see... So that's how...,7,4,0,39,39,,,
03234,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,The door knob on the floor seems suspicious.,7,4,0,40,40,,,
03235,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Is that the same wire that was tied around Nekomaru?,7,4,0,41,41,,,
03236,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,"Well, that's probably it.",7,4,0,42,42,,,
03237,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,If they knew it'd leave behind evidence like that they'd would've at least tried to do something to cover it up.,7,4,0,43,43,,,
03238,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,This guy... He gets off on this!,7,4,0,44,44,,,
03239,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Then what about the alarm?,7,4,0,45,45,,,
03240,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,I'm positive the alarm was set for 7:30 AM. And if we map it out from there...,7,4,0,46,46,,,
03241,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,"Tss, stop calling me Baby Gangster!",7,4,0,47,47,,,
03242,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Y-you didn't check it yourself? Nekomaru's alarm was set for 7:30 AM!,7,4,0,48,48,,,
03243,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,But the alarm inside Nekomaru's chest...,7,4,0,49,49,,,
03244,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,...was set for 7:30 AM!,7,4,0,50,50,,,
03245,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,"No, I checked all the clocks inside the Funhouse.",7,4,0,51,51,,,
03246,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,And because of that I can confidently declare that all the clocks had the same time displayed.,7,4,0,52,52,,,
03247,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,"Yeah, none of the clocks had the wrong time.",7,4,0,53,53,,,
03248,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Wh-wha-? All the clocks?,7,4,0,54,54,,,
03249,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,"Kh, so that's what it was. There's no way I would've noticed that.",7,4,0,55,55,,,
03250,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,The time of death...,7,4,0,56,56,,,
03251,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,...was clearly 7:30 AM!,7,4,0,57,57,,,
03252,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,"We were starving pretty badly, there's no way we would've noticed.",7,4,0,58,58,,,
03253,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Then... When I witnessed Nekomaru early in the morning...,7,4,0,59,59,,,
03254,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Huh? What the hell do you mean?,7,4,0,60,60,,,
03255,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Are you talking about that alarm?,7,4,0,61,61,,,
03256,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,"A little while after I witnessed Nekomaru, the clock in the Strawberry House lounge started going off!",7,4,0,62,62,,,
03257,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,"Plus, it was just before that... rumbling sound occurred. That's it! So that's what it is!",7,4,0,63,63,,,
03258,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,If Nekomaru died when the rumble happened then whoever doesn't have an alibi at the time is the prime suspect!,7,4,0,64,64,,,
03259,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,You didn't come out even though the alarm was going off like crazy!,7,4,0,65,65,,,
03260,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,"You weren't in your room, were you?",7,4,0,66,66,,,
03261,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,D-d-decisive factor?,7,4,0,67,67,,,
03262,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,M-me?,7,4,0,68,68,,,
03263,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Because... I was in the lounge.,7,4,0,69,69,,,
03264,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,You bastard! Do you understand the situation you're in right now?,7,4,0,70,70,,,
03265,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,I see... The contact elevator was broken.,7,4,0,71,71,,,
03266,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,It would've been different if they had an accomplice.,7,4,0,72,72,,,
03267,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,"H-h-hold on. If Nekomaru didn't go to Strawberry Tower, what would the killer have done then?",7,4,0,73,73,,,
03268,Fuyuhiko,Trial 4,Are you seriously saying he used his hamsters to press the button on Nekomaru's neck?,7,4,0,74,74,,,
03269,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,If he was killed for trying to reveal the traitor...,7,5,0,1,1,,,
03270,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,...that traitor is obviously the killer! They were trying to shut Nagito up!,7,5,0,2,2,,,
03271,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,H-huh? Are you trying to protect the traitor? They didn't call out when we were in danger!,7,5,0,3,3,,,
03272,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Wait... Don't tell me you're the traitor!,7,5,0,4,4,,,
03273,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,I-I found it by coincidence!,7,5,0,5,5,,,
03274,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,There's no way I'd torture someone!,7,5,0,6,6,,,
03275,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Perhaps the duct tape was used so he wouldn't be able to scream.,7,5,0,7,7,,,
03276,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"Then it's like I said at the beginning. The tape wasn't for torture, it was to keep his mouth shut.",7,5,0,8,8,,,
03277,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,They probably had a deep grudge against Nagito.,7,5,0,9,9,,,
03278,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"No, they didn't just go crazy. Whoever did this must be one crafty bastard.",7,5,0,10,10,,,
03279,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"If not, they wouldn't have taken the time to set fire to the crime scene and destroy all the evidence.",7,5,0,11,11,,,

03281,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Did they use the oil as an improvised fuse?,7,5,0,13,13,,,
03282,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Does that mean anything?,7,5,0,14,14,,,
03283,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,But wouldn't it be obvious that those big panels are falling over?,7,5,0,15,15,,,
03284,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Is that a problem?,7,5,0,16,16,,,
03285,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"Huh, now that you mention it...",7,5,0,17,17,,,
03286,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"Who? We were all outside the warehouse, you know?",7,5,0,18,18,,,
03287,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"Are you saying this was a suicide? Pfft, don't be stupid!",7,5,0,19,19,,,
03288,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"His body was covered in torture wounds, or did you already forget?",7,5,0,20,20,,,
03289,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,A-are you saying those were all... self-inflicted?,7,5,0,21,21,,,
03290,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"Gh-! That's not the issue! He was tied up, remember?",7,5,0,22,22,,,
03291,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"Even for a creep like Nagito, it'd be impossible to tie up his own arms and legs.",7,5,0,23,23,,,
03292,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Y-yeah. As long as you understand...,7,5,0,24,24,,,
03293,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,N-need to discuss?,7,5,0,25,25,,,
03294,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,That's not necessary at all! No matter how much you think about it it's clearly impossible!,7,5,0,26,26,,,
03295,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,To actually tied up your own arms and legs...,7,5,0,27,27,,,
03296,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,...that's obviously impossible!,7,5,0,28,28,,,
03297,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,It'd be impossible if you were by yourself!,7,5,0,29,29,,,
03298,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Wh-wha-? I mean it's no mistake that his arms and legs were-!,7,5,0,30,30,,,
03299,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,That was just... burned by the fire. He should've been tied up before that.,7,5,0,31,31,,,
03300,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,That's definitely wrong.,7,5,0,32,32,,,
03301,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"That's not what I meant, I'm talking about Nagito.",7,5,0,33,33,,,
03302,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"I mean, even if his right hand wasn't tied up... The knife was still stabbed into it, you know?",7,5,0,34,34,,,
03303,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Then hurry up and spill it!,7,5,0,35,35,,,
03304,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Even if Nagito's right hand was free...,7,5,0,36,36,,,
03305,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,...how could he stab his right hand with his right hand?,7,5,0,37,37,,,
03306,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"If you're tied up, your arms won't bend that easily.",7,5,0,38,38,,,
03307,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,We don't know if his left hand could even reach his right hand!,7,5,0,39,39,,,
03308,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,I get what you're saying about the wounds on his right hand but there's still one huge problem...,7,5,0,40,40,,,
03309,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"The spear! Basically you're saying Nagito committed suicide by impaling himself with the spear, right?",7,5,0,41,41,,,
03310,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"If you think about the order, geting killed by the spear should've been the last thing that happened to Nagito.",7,5,0,42,42,,,
03311,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"If that's true, how is that possible?",7,5,0,43,43,,,
03312,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,He can't grab the spear with his right hand if a knife is stabbed into it and his left hand was all tied up.,7,5,0,44,44,,,
03313,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"Hey bastard, better cut it out!",7,5,0,45,45,,,
03314,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,I also wanna believe that there's no killer but suicide is unimaginable.,7,5,0,46,46,,,
03315,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,But his left hand was also tied up!,7,5,0,47,47,,,
03316,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,But even if he held the spear with his tied up left hand it'd be impossible for him to stab himself!,7,5,0,48,48,,,
03317,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,But why ias it so important to know which part of the spear he was gripping?,7,5,0,49,49,,,
03318,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,...,7,5,0,50,50,,,
03319,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Then... This is for real?,7,5,0,51,51,,,
03320,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,He... really committed suicide?,7,5,0,52,52,,,
03321,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Every single wound on his body... That was all him?,7,5,0,53,53,,,
03322,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,A-and that's why he stabbed himself over and over again?,7,5,0,54,54,,,
03323,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,I bet the bomb scare was part of the strategy behind his trick!,7,5,0,55,55,,,
03324,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,He made us split up and search for a bomb so none of us would have an alibi!,7,5,0,56,56,,,
03325,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,He created a scenario where any of us could've killed him!,7,5,0,57,57,,,
03326,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,He's a fucking bastard who killed himself for his delusions of grandeur! It's not that unthinkable!,7,5,0,58,58,,,
03327,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Yeah. It appears we've come to a conclusion.,7,5,0,59,59,,,
03328,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,That bastard Nagito committed suicide. It was all done by him so we'd be executed.,7,5,0,60,60,,,
03329,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Wh-what? You're not satisfied yet?,7,5,0,61,61,,,
03330,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"What do you think, Akane?",7,5,0,62,62,,,
03331,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"H-hold on, why?",7,5,0,63,63,,,
03332,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"But the issue here is who killed Nagito, right? Even if we identify the traitor, the conclusion won't change.",7,5,0,64,64,,,
03333,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"*Sigh* Hold on a sec, then are you saying there's more to Nagito's death?",7,5,0,65,65,,,
03334,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"Are you suggesting, again, that his death wasn't a suicide?",7,5,0,66,66,,,
03335,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"Just to be safe, huh?",7,5,0,67,67,,,
03336,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,*Sigh* Guess I have no choice. If that's the case I'll do my best to go along with it.,7,5,0,68,68,,,
03337,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"Other possibilities, huh...",7,5,0,69,69,,,
03338,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Are we finished already?,7,5,0,70,70,,,
03339,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,With all those wounds...,7,5,0,71,71,,,
03340,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,...maybe he simply bled to death?,7,5,0,72,72,,,
03341,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"However, it's common for blood blotches to appear on a body that's been poisoned.",7,5,0,73,73,,,
03342,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,What does that mean?,7,5,0,74,74,,,
03343,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,D-did he wound his body just to camouflage them?,7,5,0,75,75,,,
03344,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Then it's impossible! Both his hands were full just before he died.,7,5,0,76,76,,,
03345,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"His mouth was covered with duct tape, you know? If he wanted to drink poison how'd he get it past his lips?",7,5,0,77,77,,,
03346,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Hell no! No matter how you slice it he was totally killed by that spear!,7,5,0,78,78,,,
03347,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"Well, with this we have a clearer picture. We've also determind the true cause of death.",7,5,0,79,79,,,
03348,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"Alright, all the mysteries should be solved now. We should get on with the voting time, right?",7,5,0,80,80,,,
03349,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"H-hey, what happened? There's no reason to wonder about that stuff anymore, y'know?",7,5,0,81,81,,,
03350,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,The container probably melted in the fire.,7,5,0,82,82,,,
03351,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Y-you're right. Someone might've accidentally took it away from the crime scene.,7,5,0,83,83,,,
03352,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"I-I get what you're saying but... In the end, the reason he died is still the same as before, right?",7,5,0,84,84,,,
03353,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"Even if we solve this mystery, the conclusion won't change at all!",7,5,0,85,85,,,
03354,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Huh? That's just a piece of trash.,7,5,0,86,86,,,
03355,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Did he... use those when put the poision inside the fire grenade?,7,5,0,87,87,,,
03356,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"See, I told you. The conclusion is still the same. Nagito committed suicide, end of story.",7,5,0,88,88,,,
03357,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,What did you say?,7,5,0,89,89,,,
03358,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,One of us threw the poison grenade that killed Nagito?,7,5,0,90,90,,,
03359,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,He set the fire just so we'd put it out? Why'd he do that?,7,5,0,91,91,,,
03360,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,A trap?,7,5,0,92,92,,,
03361,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,C-could it be-? Was that Nagito's trap?,7,5,0,93,93,,,
03362,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"H-h-h-hol-hold on! If that's true, you can't say the poison was the cause of death!",7,5,0,94,94,,,
03363,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,It might be the poison's fault he let go of the spear but the actual cause of death could be either one.,7,5,0,95,95,,,
03364,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Are you fucking serious?,7,5,0,96,96,,,
03365,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,That's not the fucking issue here!,7,5,0,97,97,,,

03368,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,And what's wrong with that?,7,5,0,100,100,,,
03369,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,"That's not so strange, really. Most of us here have been relying on the same thing.",7,5,0,101,101,,,
03370,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Wh-what did he do?,7,5,0,102,102,,,
03371,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Then he... He relied on his luck to weed out the traitor?,7,5,0,103,103,,,
03372,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Then..  what he said in his video message...,7,5,0,104,104,,,
03373,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,It means he wants us to beat the traitor!,7,5,0,105,105,,,

03377,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Looks like... we gotta do what we can.,7,5,0,109,109,,,
03378,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,It's not like I believe she's the traitor. There's just no way we can ignore this without confirming it.,7,5,0,110,110,,,
03379,Fuyuhiko,Trial 5,Is the traitor's identity written in here?,7,5,0,111,111,,,

03387,Fuyuhiko,Trial 6,"Don't fucking mess with me, you bastard! Did you have us all come here just to tell us bullshit?",7,6,0,2,2,,,

03389,Fuyuhiko,Trial 6,Don't fuck with me! That's not even possible!,7,6,0,4,4,,,
03390,Fuyuhiko,Trial 6,You better not say we're fictional characters!,7,6,0,5,5,,,
03391,Fuyuhiko,Trial 6,Wh-what did you remove?,7,6,0,6,6,,,
03392,Fuyuhiko,Trial 6,I-I can't believe that. You're just making shit up!,7,6,0,7,7,,,

03394,Fuyuhiko,Trial 6,"No, now that I think about it it's definitely strange.",7,6,0,9,9,,,
03395,Fuyuhiko,Trial 6,Our school memories... About how many days worth were taken away?,7,6,0,10,10,,,
03396,Fuyuhiko,Trial 6,Peko and I have seen each other almost every single day of our lives.,7,6,0,11,11,,,

03413,Fuyuhiko,Trial 6,Yeah. Didn't get weird until Usami was remodelled as Monomi.,7,6,0,28,28,,,
03414,Fuyuhiko,Trial 6,You're saying Chiaki was an NPC?,7,6,0,29,29,,,

03701,Ibuki,Trial 2,What does that mean?,14,2,0,24,24,,,
03702,Ibuki,Trial 2,But why did the killer block the door?,14,2,0,25,25,,,
03703,Ibuki,Trial 2,If she didn't change her clothes then what did Hiyoko do with the blood that got on her?,14,2,0,26,26,,,

03716,Ibuki,Trial 2,"Oh, what about the wetsuits in the closet?",14,2,0,39,39,,,
03717,Ibuki,Trial 2,Maybe they wore one when they moved the body!,14,2,0,40,40,,,
03718,Ibuki,Trial 2,They cut it up and *flush*!,14,2,0,41,41,,,
03719,Ibuki,Trial 2,Dowsing your body with lots of water bottles is such a simple and easy to understand explanation. ,14,2,0,42,42,,,

03859,Monokuma,Trial 1,"Well, putting that aside, let's move along to the nerve-racking voting time!",16,1,0,23,23,,,
03860,Monokuma,Trial 1,"Now then, please pull the lever in front of you and cast your votes!",16,1,0,24,24,,,
03861,Monokuma,Trial 1,"Oh, just a reminder! Make triple sure you vote for someone.",16,1,0,25,25,,,
03862,Monokuma,Trial 1,"If you don't vote, I'm gonna eat you up just like that meat from earlier!",16,1,0,26,26,,,
03863,Monokuma,Trial 1,Who will be chosen as the blackened? Will you make the right choice or the dreadfully wrong one?,16,1,0,27,27,,,
03864,Monokuma,Trial 1,"Puhuhuhuhu, such heart-pounding excitement!",16,1,0,28,28,,,
03865,Monokuma,Trial 2,"Now then, let's first discuss the motive! That masterpiece of gaming, Twilight Syndrome Murder Case.",16,2,0,1,1,,,
03866,Monokuma,Trial 2,"Umm... About that, you're probably thinking like that because you've lost your memories!",16,2,0,2,2,,,
03867,Monokuma,Trial 2,"Hey, no one cares about that! Hurry up and talk about the mystery of the game!",16,2,0,3,3,,,
03868,Monokuma,Trial 2,"My my, you don't know? I heard that Girl E got killed!",16,2,0,4,4,,,
03869,Monokuma,Trial 2,"Getting killed is so violent, don'tcha know?",16,2,0,5,5,,,
03870,Monokuma,Trial 2,"They don't remember, that's obvious. Cause their school memories were, like, totally stolen!",16,2,0,6,6,,,
03871,Monokuma,Trial 2,"Damn right, I'm such a stickler for the rules that even Safari Park rangers want nothing to do with me.",16,2,0,7,7,,,
03872,Monokuma,Trial 2,*snore*,16,2,0,8,8,,,
03873,Monokuma,Trial 2,I believe Prince Shotoku was from the future! A man from the future is always directing the flow of history.,16,2,0,9,9,,,
03874,Monokuma,Trial 2,"Yeah, that's true but uhh... Something like that is basically what it's supposed to be...",16,2,0,10,10,,,
03875,Monokuma,Trial 2,Jeez! You're pretty annoying for noticing something like that!,16,2,0,11,11,,,
03876,Monokuma,Trial 2,I know it sounds like an excuse but the Body Discovery Announcement isn't supposed to be used for deduction!,16,2,0,12,12,,,
03877,Monokuma,Trial 2,It's intended to create a fair trial. It's supposed to let everyone know that a body has been found.,16,2,0,13,13,,,
03878,Monokuma,Trial 2,"Well, as long as I keep things ambiguous I can respond to things with some flexibility.",16,2,0,14,14,,,
03879,Monokuma,Trial 2,"Jeez, fine, fine! You want me to say it? It doesn't include the killer this time, okay? All done!",16,2,0,15,15,,,
03880,Monokuma,Trial 2,*snore* I'm awake!,16,2,0,16,16,,,
03881,Monokuma,Trial 2,"I've heard your story! Well, I wasn't listening but who cares!",16,2,0,17,17,,,
03882,Monokuma,Trial 2,"Hmm, I'm in a bind... And what a bind it is...",16,2,0,18,18,,,
03883,Monokuma,Trial 2,I guess for now let's take a quick recess. We'll be right back after this commercial break!,16,2,0,19,19,,,
03884,Monokuma,Trial 3,"Oh well, who cares about this boring explanation. Let's get on with  it already!",16,3,0,1,1,,,
03885,Monokuma,Trial 3,"Yes, no mistakes there.",16,3,0,2,2,,,
03886,Monokuma,Trial 3,ME TOOOOOO?,16,3,0,3,3,,,
03887,Monokuma,Trial 3,"Are you kidding me? You haven't seen my masterpiece ""The Wizard of Monomi 2.5D""?",16,3,0,4,4,,,
03888,Monokuma,Trial 3,You're pretty noisy for someone who eats moss balls!,16,3,0,5,5,,,
03889,Monokuma,Trial 3,"Well, it's against the rules to kill three people in the first place!",16,3,0,6,6,,,
03890,Monokuma,Trial 3,"The same as always, you have to vote for who the killer is.",16,3,0,7,7,,,
03891,Monokuma,Trial 3,"Think about it, a suicide means you killed the most important existence of all: yourself.",16,3,0,8,8,,,
03892,Monokuma,Trial 3,Unfortunately that means there's no blackened to punish but I guess in a pinch I could always punish Monomi.,16,3,0,9,9,,,
03893,Monokuma,Trial 3,"That's right! It's so half-assed, just like Monomi.",16,3,0,10,10,,,
03894,Monokuma,Trial 3,"Actually, this is a game!",16,3,0,11,11,,,
03895,Monokuma,Trial 3,"Whoa there, before that a moment of your time.",16,3,0,12,12,,,
03896,Monokuma,Trial 3,It seems your arguments have reached a conclusion so let's proceed to our regularly scheduled voting time!,16,3,0,13,13,,,
03897,Monokuma,Trial 3,Let's go!,16,3,0,14,14,,,
03898,Monokuma,Trial 3,"Well, it's against the rules to kill three people in the first place!",16,3,0,15,15,,,
03899,Monokuma,Trial 4,I'm sure you guys are starving by now but let's get revved up and raring to go!,16,4,0,1,1,,,
03900,Monokuma,Trial 4,"Whoever survives will be treated to a fancy lunch! Guess what, rabbit curry is on the menu!",16,4,0,2,2,,,
03901,Monokuma,Trial 4,You've just been kuma'd!,16,4,0,3,3,,,
03902,Monokuma,Trial 4,Gyahahahaha! Don't you think a building full of so many surprises totally deserves to be called a Funhouse?,16,4,0,4,4,,,
03903,Monokuma,Trial 4,That's right! Those two hoses exist on different floors in the same building!,16,4,0,5,5,,,
03904,Monokuma,Trial 4,"Did you hear that, Monomi?",16,4,0,6,6,,,
03905,Monokuma,Trial 4,Then I'll take responsibility and gently caress you...,16,4,0,7,7,,,
03906,Monokuma,Trial 4,"Well, a Funhouse is an amusement park attraction, you know?",16,4,0,8,8,,,
03907,Monokuma,Trial 4,"And since the building doesn't really need to be sturcturally practical, it makes for some splending fun!",16,4,0,9,9,,,
03908,Monokuma,Trial 4,You say I'm inhuman but I'm just a bear! So I was never human to begin with.,16,4,0,10,10,,,
03909,Monokuma,Trial 4,I'm different from these lowly humans.,16,4,0,11,11,,,
03910,Monokuma,Trial 4,Ah-!,16,4,0,12,12,,,
03911,Monokuma,Trial 4,"Aw jeez! That's, well, how should I put it?",16,4,0,13,13,,,
03912,Monokuma,Trial 4,"Umm... What was it? You know, tripping over a foot or something like that.",16,4,0,14,14,,,
03913,Monokuma,Trial 4,Wrong! Too bad!,16,4,0,15,15,,,
03914,Monokuma,Trial 4,That's not it. It's incorrect.,16,4,0,16,16,,,
03915,Monokuma,Trial 4,Hey! What do you mean the class trial is just the opening act?,16,4,0,17,17,,,
03916,Monokuma,Trial 4,"Ah, you said ""opening act"" again!",16,4,0,18,18,,,
03917,Monokuma,Trial 4,"Hmm, this result isn't all that exciting.",16,4,0,19,19,,,
03918,Monokuma,Trial 4,Please pull the lev-gah!,16,4,0,20,20,,,
03919,Monokuma,Trial 4,"Crap, I bit my tongue at the most important part!",16,4,0,21,21,,,
03920,Monokuma,Trial 5,"Oh my, Monomi? My cute little sister? You're awfully quiet, what's happened to you?",16,5,0,1,1,,,
03921,Monokuma,Trial 5,You've ascended the letter to adulthood and reached the moon because you're a rabbit?,16,5,0,2,2,,,
03922,Monokuma,Trial 5,It's useless.,16,5,0,3,3,,,
03923,Monokuma,Trial 5,"You're right, now's now the time for me to horse around with Monomi. The class trial's started after all.",16,5,0,4,4,,,
03924,Monokuma,Trial 5,The victim this time is Nagito who was attempting to reveal the traitor for everyone's sake.,16,5,0,5,5,,,
03925,Monokuma,Trial 5,Who in the world killed him? I'm sooo curious!,16,5,0,6,6,,,
03926,Monokuma,Trial 5,"Puhuhuhuhu, now that's more like it! Why don't you guys hurry and start arguing already?",16,5,0,7,7,,,
03927,Monokuma,Trial 5,"A bleeding plushie is super scary, it's got the same fear factor as a doll whose hair grows too long!",16,5,0,8,8,,,
03928,Monokuma,Trial 5,"You say you can't believe it? Puhuhuhuhu, you just don't want to believe it, right?",16,5,0,9,9,,,
03929,Monokuma,Trial 5,"But that's why you keep getting betrayed over and over again, right? Same goes for this time, too...",16,5,0,10,10,,,
03930,Monokuma,Trial 5,"Gah, Monomi's sassing me!",16,5,0,11,11,,,
03931,Monokuma,Trial 5,So what are you gonna do? Is it okay to proceed with the voting time?,16,5,0,12,12,,,
03932,Monokuma,Trial 5,Then it's okay? It's okay to say you've decided on the killer?,16,5,0,13,13,,,
03933,Monokuma,Trial 5,"Understood, then voting ti-!",16,5,0,14,14,,,
03934,Monokuma,Trial 5,Ghhh!,16,5,0,15,15,,,
03935,Monokuma,Trial 5,I plead the fifth!,16,5,0,16,16,,,
03936,Monokuma,Trial 5,"Puhuhuhuhu, how interesting! You sure do believe in Nagito, huh?",16,5,0,17,17,,,
03937,Monokuma,Trial 5,"Because you believe in his malice, you continue to suspect his malice!",16,5,0,18,18,,,
03938,Monokuma,Trial 5,"I see, I guess that's what passes for friendship these days.",16,5,0,19,19,,,
03939,Monokuma,Trial 5,"So Nagito's ghost is whispering to you, huh?",16,5,0,20,20,,,
03940,Monokuma,Trial 5,"Puhuhuhuhu, the power of friendship bursts beyond death, huh? A fiery outcome like this is right out of a teen manga!",16,5,0,21,21,,,
03941,Monokuma,Trial 5,"Still, that's pretty messed up!",16,5,0,22,22,,,
03942,Monokuma,Trial 5,"That's right, Nagito's killer is the one who made him breathe the poison!",16,5,0,23,23,,,
03943,Monokuma,Trial 5,He probably expected that his fake suicide would be found out.,16,5,0,24,24,,,
03944,Monokuma,Trial 5,"After all, a mystery that can be solved is destined to be solved in the end.",16,5,0,25,25,,,
03945,Monokuma,Trial 5,"However, he also prepared a mystery that couldn't be solved!",16,5,0,26,26,,,
03946,Monokuma,Trial 5,"As you solve mysteries and bolster your hope, a huge mystery comes along and slaps you in your faces!",16,5,0,27,27,,,
03947,Monokuma,Trial 5,"For those of you who believe there are no unsolvable mysteries, that is when you finally taste despair.",16,5,0,28,28,,,
03948,Monokuma,Trial 5,"Meaning, he used all of the prior class trial verdicts to prepare this trick.",16,5,0,29,29,,,
03949,Monokuma,Trial 5,"Not all mysteries can be solved. Puhuhuhuhu, such a devious trick he played on you. As expected of Nagito.",16,5,0,30,30,,,
03950,Monokuma,Trial 5,"You know, I don't actually need stuff like cheap-ass surveillance cameras or whatever.",16,5,0,31,31,,,
03951,Monokuma,Trial 5,I know perfectly well what's happening on this island at all times!,16,5,0,32,32,,,
03952,Monokuma,Trial 5,"I know used the bathroom three times yesterday, Sonia. And one of those visits seemed to take a while.",16,5,0,33,33,,,
03953,Monokuma,Trial 5,"So, of course this trial still counts. Do your very best to guess who the killer is!",16,5,0,34,34,,,
03954,Monokuma,Trial 5,"Monomi, it looks like you've got something you wanna say! But you better just keep your mouth shut!",16,5,0,35,35,,,
03955,Monokuma,Trial 5,"Hey, are you trying to cover for her like that? You suck!",16,5,0,36,36,,,
03956,Monokuma,Trial 5,"That's right! Since I knew something like this would happen, I made sure to bring it here today!",16,5,0,37,37,,,
03957,Monokuma,Trial 5,"Hey, what have you two been talking about? Everyone's jaws are dropping, you know?",16,5,0,38,38,,,
03958,Monokuma,Trial 6,I did say I wanted you guys to know the outside world but this is still a questionable starting topic.,16,6,0,1,1,,,
03959,Monokuma,Trial 6,"Let me ask you this, what is this world's true identity?",16,6,0,2,2,,,
03960,Monokuma,Trial 6,It's a virtual world that was inspired by the actual Jabberwock Island!,16,6,0,3,3,,,
03961,Monokuma,Trial 6,"Sooo, this isn't the real world but if you want you can call it the ""game world""!",16,6,0,4,4,,,
03962,Monokuma,Trial 6,You get it? It's all just one big game!,16,6,0,5,5,,,
03963,Monokuma,Trial 6,"I know, I know. The ""all in your mind"" trope makes you feel such cruel despair!",16,6,0,6,6,,,
03964,Monokuma,Trial 6,But who cares? I revived all the suspense and mystery with just one line!,16,6,0,7,7,,,
03965,Monokuma,Trial 6,Cuz it's a game!,16,6,0,8,8,,,
03966,Monokuma,Trial 6,"I know you guys are pissed but you were having fun too, right? A world where anything goes only exists in games.",16,6,0,9,9,,,
03967,Monokuma,Trial 6,"Sooo, just force yourself to accept it!",16,6,0,10,10,,,
03968,Monokuma,Trial 6,"This closed space, this game world, was the true stage of this killing school trip.",16,6,0,11,11,,,
03969,Monokuma,Trial 6,"Back in the day, people must've reacted the same way when they first saw the airplane take flight.",16,6,0,12,12,,,
03970,Monokuma,Trial 6,"But like wearing contact lenses, it'll stop feeling strange once you just get used to it.",16,6,0,13,13,,,
03971,Monokuma,Trial 6,The Future Foundation created this world using a program called the Neo World Program.,16,6,0,14,14,,,
03972,Monokuma,Trial 6,It's programmed to place the user in a virtual world by synchronizing directly with the user's brain!,16,6,0,15,15,,,
03973,Monokuma,Trial 6,"Which means, your bodies still exist in the real world.",16,6,0,16,16,,,
03974,Monokuma,Trial 6,"But right now, you're completely submerged in the game world as if you're dreaming or something.",16,6,0,17,17,,,
03975,Monokuma,Trial 6,"Simply put, your, umm... You know, not ""aviators"" but...",16,6,0,18,18,,,
03976,Monokuma,Trial 6,Your avatars were constructed by removing a specific thing from your bodies in the real world.,16,6,0,19,19,,,
03977,Monokuma,Trial 6,"How many times do I have to tell you? It's not sci-fi, it's a game!",16,6,0,20,20,,,
03978,Monokuma,Trial 6,You are the evidence!,16,6,0,21,21,,,
03979,Monokuma,Trial 6,Your avatar's made of memories from before you entered the school!,16,6,0,22,22,,,
03980,Monokuma,Trial 6,But your actual bodies in the real world are different!,16,6,0,23,23,,,
03981,Monokuma,Trial 6,Though you have no memories of your time living your school life...,16,6,0,24,24,,,
03982,Monokuma,Trial 6,...your real bodies actually lived that life!,16,6,0,25,25,,,
03983,Monokuma,Trial 6,"It appears Hiyoko had a growth spurt during the school year. Looks like the other shortie graduated, Fuyuhiko!",16,6,0,26,26,,,
03984,Monokuma,Trial 6,"But if you guys only had memory loss, your bodies still should've grown during that time, right?",16,6,0,27,27,,,
03985,Monokuma,Trial 6,So you should've felt your bodies go through growth spurts. But why didn't you guys recognize each other?,16,6,0,28,28,,,
03986,Monokuma,Trial 6,"As the creators of the Neo World Program, only the Future Foundation would know the details but...",16,6,0,29,29,,,
03987,Monokuma,Trial 6,"Around 2 or 3 years worth, I assume.",16,6,0,30,30,,,
03988,Monokuma,Trial 6,Your refusal to accept your mutual memory loss is why you can't notice all the important parts!,16,6,0,31,31,,,
03989,Monokuma,Trial 6,"You've lost your memories, end of story! You guys are avatars who had their memories taken from them.",16,6,0,32,32,,,
03990,Monokuma,Trial 6,"Just because it's a game, doesn't mean everything was a lie.",16,6,0,33,33,,,
03991,Monokuma,Trial 6,"Have you heard that when you're hypnotized to believe you've been burned, a burn mark will really appear?",16,6,0,34,34,,,
03992,Monokuma,Trial 6,Puhuhuhuhu...,16,6,0,35,35,,,
03993,Monokuma,Trial 6,"If a lie is a believable lie, it might become the truth. That's what you said earlier, fuyuhiko!",16,6,0,36,36,,,

03996,Monokuma,Trial 6,...their brains inside their actual bodies will stop functioning too!,16,6,0,39,39,,,
03997,Monokuma,Trial 6,It's not like their bodies are completely dead so I can't say it's a true death but...,16,6,0,40,40,,,
03998,Monokuma,Trial 6,...that's why it's actualyl crueler instead! All that's left of them are empty husks.,16,6,0,41,41,,,
03999,Monokuma,Trial 6,"Well, nobody's gonna appreciate a game where you don't die when you're supposed to, right?",16,6,0,42,42,,,
04000,Monokuma,Trial 6,"Ah, if you want to be mad please be mad at the Future Foundation. They're forcing you to play this game.",16,6,0,43,43,,,
04001,Monokuma,Trial 6,"Monomi, what sort of role did such a lost girl like her have in this world?",16,6,0,44,44,,,
04002,Monokuma,Trial 6,"That's right, she was an NPC that was assigned the role of ""observer""!",16,6,0,45,45,,,
04003,Monokuma,Trial 6,Monomi's existence was created entirely by the program just to monitor the 15 of you.,16,6,0,46,46,,,
04004,Monokuma,Trial 6,Don't get all mushy towards a game character!,16,6,0,47,47,,,
04005,Monokuma,Trial 6,"Plus, she wasn't just a little game character. She was a lackey for the detestable World Ender!",16,6,0,48,48,,,
04006,Monokuma,Trial 6,"No, there's no doubt that the Future Foundation is also World Ender. At least for those of us here.",16,6,0,49,49,,,

04010,Monokuma,Trial 6,You're also survivors of Ultimate Despair!,16,6,0,53,53,,,
04011,Monokuma,Trial 6,He's the only one who knew this truth before you guys! It was a special price for clearing the Final Dead Room!,16,6,0,54,54,,,
04012,Monokuma,Trial 6,"It's just a game, anyway. So why don't you just let it out? I'm pretty sure a select few would demand that...",16,6,0,55,55,,,
04013,Monokuma,Trial 6,"However, if you graduate from here your school memories will never return!",16,6,0,56,56,,,
04014,Monokuma,Trial 6,"Ahem, please take a look at this flip book for a quick rundown of your options.",16,6,0,57,57,,,
04015,Monokuma,Trial 6,"If you choose ""Graduate"" it'll transfer your in-game memories but your school memories will be gone forever!",16,6,0,58,58,,,

04017,Monokuma,Trial 6,You don't have to force yourself to return to a painful reality. Let's just play this game forever and ever!,16,6,0,60,60,,,
04018,Monokuma,Trial 6,"Wh-who is he? Simply put, he's Makoto Naegi who's known for being a cutie patootie!",16,6,0,61,61,,,

04680,Monomi,CG,Wh-what? There's no way I can do that!,17,99,2,118,630,,,
04681,Monomi,CG,Why would you ask such a cruel question?,17,99,2,119,631,,,
04682,Monomi,CG,"So, a god of comedy wants blood?",17,99,2,120,632,,,
04683,Monomi,CG,"No matter how charmingly you ask, there's no way I'll let you take my blood!",17,99,2,121,633,,,

04689,Monomi,CG,"P-please, stop!",17,99,2,127,639,,,
04690,Monomi,CG,"S-seriously, this is bad in so many ways!",17,99,2,128,640,,,
04691,Monomi,CG,Gyah! His backhand is far to powerful!,17,99,2,129,641,,,
04692,Monomi,CG,It hurts so much when you hit me with a charging corkscrew attack!,17,99,2,130,642,,,
04693,Monomi,CG,Gahhh!,17,99,2,131,643,,,
04694,Monomi,CG,My body can't handle a supersonic meteor rush like that!,17,99,2,132,644,,,
04695,Monomi,CG,Huhuwaah! An ambulance?,17,99,2,133,645,,,
04696,Monomi,CG,Dr. Killgood? You've already killed your patients!,17,99,2,134,646,,,
04697,Monomi,CG,"You guys can see it, right? You can see this countdown too?",17,99,2,135,647,,,
04698,Monomi,CG,Four people are already gone...,17,99,2,136,648,,,
04699,Monomi,CG,"We took our time preparing the Hope Fragments, but now we're no longer able to gather them!",17,99,2,137,649,,,
04700,Monomi,CG,"Honestly, I'm not so sure anymore...",17,99,2,138,650,,,
04701,Monomi,CG,Whether it's better if we let them leave this island or if we shouldn't let them escape!,17,99,2,139,651,,,
04702,Monomi,CG,"For those kids, which option is hope and which is despair?",17,99,2,140,652,,,
04703,Monomi,CG,"But, I guess there's no time to hesitate. If this countdown reaches zero...",17,99,2,141,653,,,
04704,Monomi,CG,...that guy will probably take over our plan's final stage as well!,17,99,2,142,654,,,
04705,Monomi,CG,What lies beyond that is the foul resurrection of the Ultimate Despair!,17,99,2,143,655,,,
04706,Monomi,CG,"And the continuation of the Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Human History!",17,99,2,144,656,,,
04707,Monomi,CG,Th-that cannot be allowed! We must prevent that by any means necessary!,17,99,2,145,657,,,
04708,Monomi,CG,"Even if we have to pay the ultimate price, I will definitely prevent it by any means!",17,99,2,146,658,,,
04709,Monomi,CG,Everything is for the sake of a future filled with hope!,17,99,2,147,659,,,
04710,Monomi,CG,Huwaa! This again?,17,99,2,148,660,,,
04711,Monomi,CG,He even recycled the same line again!,17,99,2,149,661,,,
04712,Monomi,CG,I don't even know what's been done to me but I feel a mysterious light energy!,17,99,2,150,662,,,
04713,Monomi,CG,"This technique, it's impossible to defend against it or evade it!",17,99,2,151,663,,,
04714,Monomi,CG,"H-hold on, Nagito! What are you doing?",17,99,2,152,664,,,
04715,Monomi,CG,You-you can't! Please stop!,17,99,2,153,665,,,
04716,Monomi,CG,"H-Please, stop!",17,99,2,154,666,,,
04717,Monomi,CG,What a hopeless way of snapping back!,17,99,2,155,667,,,
04718,Monomi,CG,I will no longer let you do as you please!,17,99,2,156,668,,,
04719,Monomi,CG,"Geh! As I say, we shall die together!",17,99,2,157,669,,,
04720,Monomi,CG,"If I don't beat you, gu-uh! No body can... live in peace!",17,99,2,158,670,,,
04721,Monomi,CG,Bye-bye! Please don't forget about your teacher!,17,99,2,159,671,,,
04722,Monomi,CG,You're so evil!,17,99,2,160,672,,,
04723,Monomi,CG,Umm...,17,99,2,161,673,,,
04724,Monomi,CG,Ummm...,17,99,2,162,674,,,
04725,Monomi,CG,Ha?,17,99,2,163,675,,,
04726,Monomi,CG,Huwaa!,17,99,2,164,676,,,
04727,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,What? World Ender?,20,6,0,1,1,,,
04728,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"It's not the Future Foundation's fault! Rather, the fault lies...",20,6,0,2,2,,,
04729,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,...with you guys!,20,6,0,3,3,,,
04730,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"My name is Makoto Naegi. Like you, I'm also a former student of Hope's Peak Academy.",20,6,0,4,4,,,
04731,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"And right now, I'm a member of the Future Foundation!",20,6,0,5,5,,,
04732,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,...,20,6,0,6,6,,,
04733,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,...,20,6,0,7,7,,,
04734,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"Of course. I don't mind rescuing you guys, but before that...",20,6,0,8,8,,,
04735,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,...you all need to fully accept the situation you're in!,20,6,0,9,9,,,
04736,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,Why do you think the Future Foundation decided to put you guys into the Neo World Program?,20,6,0,10,10,,,
04737,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,The Neo World Program has another name: The Hope Restoration Program.,20,6,0,11,11,,,
04738,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"By now, you should understand your true identity.",20,6,0,12,12,,,
04739,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,...,20,6,0,13,13,,,
04740,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"Before you arrived here, Monokuma should've shown you guys some clues.",20,6,0,14,14,,,
04741,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,Put them all together and try thinking about it!,20,6,0,15,15,,,
04742,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,Who're the 15 survivors of Hope's Peak Academy? Who're the Remnants of Despair?,20,6,0,16,16,,,
04743,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,If you put it together and think about it you should be able to understand why you were put into the program.,20,6,0,17,17,,,
04744,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"Yes, both of those phrases refer to you guys!",20,6,0,18,18,,,
04745,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,That's right! Not only are you guys the survivors of Hope's Peak Academy...,20,6,0,19,19,,,
04746,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,In the beginning we took in 15 of you as survivors of Hope's Peak Academy.,20,6,0,20,20,,,
04747,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,But opun further investigation we discovered an unbelievable truth!,20,6,0,21,21,,,
04748,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,The 15 people we acquired were actually the horrifying Remnants of Despair!,20,6,0,22,22,,,
04749,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"Yes, they're responsible for the Tragedy and brought chaos into the world!",20,6,0,23,23,,,
04750,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,Despair in human form but utterly devoid of humanity. That's what you guys really are!,20,6,0,24,24,,,
04751,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,The Ultimate Despairs don't care about principles or morals. They just spread despair everytwhere they go.,20,6,0,25,25,,,
04752,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"They live solely to torment everything, to burn everything, to kill everything.",20,6,0,26,26,,,
04753,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,Nagito probably did what he did because he managed to learn the unbelievable truth.,20,6,0,27,27,,,
04754,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"No, it used to have profiles from after you enter the school but Nagito destroyed them before you saw it.",20,6,0,28,28,,,
04755,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"Anyway, it's the absolute truth that the file had profiles about you guys after you entered the school.",20,6,0,29,29,,,
04756,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"And after Nagito obtained the file and learn the truth, what did he try and do to you guys?",20,6,0,30,30,,,
04757,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"That's right! After seeing the file he learned that everyone, including him, was Ultimate Despair.",20,6,0,31,31,,,
04758,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,And he tried to kill everyone except the traitor!,20,6,0,32,32,,,
04759,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"Yes, because of his love for hope and his hatred toward despair. I sort of... understand that feeling.",20,6,0,33,33,,,
04760,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,It might seem unbelievable because you guys only have memories from before you entered the school...,20,6,0,34,34,,,
04761,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,...but it all happened at Hope's Peak Academy!,20,6,0,35,35,,,
04762,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,You were tainted by Ultimate Despair because at Hope's Peak Academy you were in contact with her...,20,6,0,36,36,,,
04763,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"...the true Ultimate Despair, Junko Enoshima!",20,6,0,37,37,,,
04764,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,She strongly influenced you all during your time at the school and that's why you became Ultimate Despair!,20,6,0,38,38,,,
04765,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,In order to remove that influence you've been placed into the Hope Restoration Program.,20,6,0,39,39,,,
04766,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,The reason you're able to act like your normal selves is because you're within the Neo World Program.,20,6,0,40,40,,,
04767,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,But your true bodies in the real world are different!,20,6,0,41,41,,,
04768,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"In the real world, you're part of a group that cruely destroyed your family, friends and even your own body!",20,6,0,42,42,,,
04769,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,Don't turn away from the truth!,20,6,0,43,43,,,
04770,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,It appears you've remembered a little.,20,6,0,44,44,,,
04771,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"Now, face what you've done! And from there you will finally take your first steps on the path to hope.",20,6,0,45,45,,,
04772,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,Because you're all Ultimate Despair...,20,6,0,46,46,,,
04773,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,...you killed your friends and family.,20,6,0,47,47,,,
04774,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,And you even destroyed your own bodies!,20,6,0,48,48,,,
04775,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,To doubt hope?,20,6,0,49,49,,,
04776,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,How much despair is within you guys!,20,6,0,50,50,,,
04777,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,Not just any woman's arm! It was the late Junko Enoshima's arm.,20,6,0,51,51,,,
04778,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,He probably thought that by becoming one with Junko Enoshima he could make her survive within him.,20,6,0,52,52,,,
04779,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,The Ultimate Despairs defy understanding. They have no problem severing their own limbs.,20,6,0,53,53,,,
04780,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,It's too soon to feel sick. That's not even the worst thing the Ultimate Despairs have done.,20,6,0,54,54,,,
04781,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,Some wasted away to skin and bones through continuous fasting in order to reach the despair of starvation...,20,6,0,55,55,,,
04782,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,...others gave their own families to Junko just to perform killing experiments on them.,20,6,0,56,56,,,
04783,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"Not just that, after Junko's death they slaughtered countless people by forcing them to commit suicide.",20,6,0,57,57,,,
04784,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,One person even implanted one of Junko's eyes into their own socket! Perhaps they wanted to see her despair?,20,6,0,58,58,,,
04785,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"And not just that, some even tried to have children with Junko's dead body!",20,6,0,59,59,,,
04786,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,So you feel despair toward yourselves in the real world. I understand that feeling...,20,6,0,60,60,,,
04787,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"...but there's no need to worry. If you just advance toward the hope I provide, you'll definitely be saved!",20,6,0,61,61,,,
04788,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"Of course. That's my purpose after all. That's why the Neo World Program was created, too.",20,6,0,62,62,,,
04789,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"Essentially, your cohabitation inside the Neo World Program was just a simulation.",20,6,0,63,63,,,
04790,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"If we remove the memories of your time at Hope's Peak Academy, would it also remove your Ultimate Despair?",20,6,0,64,64,,,
04791,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,I guess I can say that the test was a success.,20,6,0,65,65,,,
04792,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,Even though it deviated greatly from the original plan of graduating after gathering the Hope Fragments...,20,6,0,66,66,,,
04793,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"...nevertheless, you guys were able to overcome your unexpected trials and make your way here.",20,6,0,67,67,,,
04794,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"That's why, all you need to do is choose ""Graduate"".",20,6,0,68,68,,,
04795,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,If you choose to graduate and the observer determines that there are no problems...,20,6,0,69,69,,,
04796,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,...you will complete the Hope Restoration Program and your avatar will be uploaded into your real body.,20,6,0,70,70,,,
04797,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"If an avatar that needs to be uploaded has been deleted, there's nothing we can do.",20,6,0,71,71,,,
04798,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,You'll just have to continue living your tropical life.,20,6,0,72,72,,,
04799,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,...,20,6,0,73,73,,,
04800,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,Strange? You still don't understand?,20,6,0,74,74,,,
04801,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"Normally, Ultimate Despairs like you guys would just be abandoned.",20,6,0,75,75,,,
04802,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"But I'm telling you, I'm here to help! You should be thankful for how openminded the Future Foundation is!",20,6,0,76,76,,,
04803,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"Just listen to the Future Foundation! The Future Foundation is the world's hope, you know?",20,6,0,77,77,,,
04804,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,I said I'm going to save you guys!,20,6,0,78,78,,,
04805,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,Why aren't you listening to me?,20,6,0,79,79,,,
04806,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,The Future Foundation is the world's hope...,20,6,0,80,80,,,
04807,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,...no one can defy the Future Foundation!,20,6,0,81,81,,,
04808,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,It's foolish to even think about it!,20,6,0,82,82,,,
04809,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,M-my actions?,20,6,0,83,83,,,
04810,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,Uh-!,20,6,0,84,84,,,
04811,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,...,20,6,0,85,85,,,
04812,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,Umm... What was that again?,20,6,0,86,86,,,
04813,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"Th-that's weird. Wait, you-! Where'd you find that out?",20,6,0,87,87,,,
04814,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,*Sigh*,20,6,0,88,88,,,
04815,Fake Makoto,Trial 6,"Aw man, I've been found out!",20,6,0,89,89,,,
04816,Fake Makoto + Monokuma,Trial 6,"Puhuhuhu, how disappointing! And I thought I was on the right track.",20,6,0,90,90,,,
04817,Makoto,Trial 6,Don't press it! This is Junko's trap!,20,6,0,91,91,,,
04818,Makoto,Trial 6,I'm Makoto Naegi. Makoto Naegi of the Future Foundation!,20,6,0,92,92,,,
04819,Makoto,Trial 6,"I'm sorry I'm late, I actually wanted to come rescue you sooner but...",20,6,0,93,93,,,
04820,Makoto,Trial 6,...thanks to the virus infecting the Neo World Program I wasn't able to enter.,20,6,0,94,94,,,
04821,Makoto,Trial 6,Did you also... time my arrival?,20,6,0,95,95,,,
04822,Makoto,Trial 6,"No, it doesn't matter!",20,6,0,96,96,,,
04823,Makoto,Trial 6,I'm going to save everyone! And then I'm going to settle this between us once and for all!,20,6,0,97,97,,,
04824,Makoto,Trial 6,If I hadn't then I wouldn't have been able to save everyone!,20,6,0,98,98,,,
04825,Makoto,Trial 6,I already know the risks of being here...,20,6,0,99,99,,,
04826,Makoto,Trial 6,The fact that you guys are even thinking like that is Junko's trap!,20,6,0,100,100,,,
04827,Makoto,Trial 6,She's lying to you about your dead friends coming back to life!,20,6,0,101,101,,,
04828,Makoto,Trial 6,"If you knew Junko's true goal, you'd know she's lying.",20,6,0,102,102,,,
04829,Makoto,Trial 6,Yeah! Junko's goal is to convert the Hope Restoration Program to the Despair Restoration Program.,20,6,0,103,103,,,
04830,Makoto,Trial 6,"As part of the graduation program, your avatar's memory and consciousness is uploaded into your real body.",20,6,0,104,104,,,
04831,Makoto,Trial 6,"However, none of us expected that any of the avatars would get deleted!",20,6,0,105,105,,,
04832,Makoto,Trial 6,Junko has taken advantage of that opportunity!,20,6,0,106,106,,,
04833,Makoto,Trial 6,"She intends to use her version of Alter Ego, the A. I. she stole my friend's skill to create...",20,6,0,107,107,,,
04834,Makoto,Trial 6,...and upload herself into the bodies of everyone whose avatar was deleted!,20,6,0,108,108,,,
04835,Makoto,Trial 6,"Like the real world, once an avatar is deleted from this virtual world it can't be recovered.",20,6,0,109,109,,,
04836,Makoto,Trial 6,It's actually impossible to revive them.,20,6,0,110,110,,,
04837,Makoto,Trial 6,"No, there's a reason Junko couldn't do that. That's why she made you guys kill each other.",20,6,0,111,111,,,
04838,Makoto,Trial 6,Junko usurped Usami's authority as an observer and her role as a teacher.,20,6,0,112,112,,,
04839,Makoto,Trial 6,Because Junko Enoshima is the true Ultimate Despair!,20,6,0,113,113,,,
04840,Makoto,Trial 6,She doesn't yearn for any kind of future at all! She fills every person she meets with despair.,20,6,0,114,114,,,
04841,Makoto,Trial 6,Junko robs the futures of everyone she interacts with. You Ultimate Despairs are among her many victims.,20,6,0,115,115,,,
04842,Makoto,Trial 6,That's wrong! The world isn't yearning for despair! That's the reason we can't let you escape.,20,6,0,116,116,,,
04843,Makoto,Trial 6,W-wrong! That's not it!,20,6,0,117,117,,,
04844,Makoto,Trial 6,Don't give up yet!,20,6,0,118,118,,,
04845,Makoto,Trial 6,There is a way you guys can get out of here without letting Junko out!,20,6,0,119,119,,,
04846,Makoto,Trial 6,It's a hidden command I set up in the Neo World Program.,20,6,0,120,120,,,
04847,Makoto,Trial 6,"Basically, I never believed the Neo World Program was a perfect solution.",20,6,0,121,121,,,
04848,Makoto,Trial 6,There was always a possibility might've made things even worse for you guys!,20,6,0,122,122,,,
04849,Makoto,Trial 6,So I prepared a way to shut down the program in case of emergencies.,20,6,0,123,123,,,
04850,Makoto,Trial 6,You-You know about it?,20,6,0,124,124,,,
04851,Makoto,Trial 6,...,20,6,0,125,125,,,
04852,Makoto,Trial 6,No need to worry. Even I knew we couldn't activate the shutdown.,20,6,0,126,126,,,
04853,Makoto,Trial 6,It's not that we have no chance of winning. The only reason I'm here is because there is a chance.,20,6,0,127,127,,,
04854,Makoto,Trial 6,I believe...,20,6,0,128,128,,,
04855,Makoto,Trial 6,I believe in them! I believe they will definitely come!,20,6,0,129,129,,,
04856,Makoto,Trial 6,"Kyoko, Byakuya! I knew you guys would come!",20,6,0,130,130,,,
04857,Makoto,Trial 6,I-I'm sorry!,20,6,0,131,131,,,
04858,Makoto,Trial 6,"Yeah, that's right.",20,6,0,132,132,,,
04859,Makoto,Trial 6,So how about it? There are eight people now. We have enough to activate the shutdown sequence!,20,6,0,133,133,,,
04860,Makoto,Trial 6,"If you shut down the Neo World Program, everything within the program will be deleted.",20,6,0,134,134,,,
04861,Makoto,Trial 6,"It will obviously delete Alter Ego Junko, along with your avatars here.",20,6,0,135,135,,,
04862,Makoto,Trial 6,They have to know everything or else they won't agree to do it.,20,6,0,136,136,,,
04863,Makoto,Trial 6,It might be a painful decision but I know you guys will be able to overcome it.,20,6,0,137,137,,,
04864,Makoto,Trial 6,"That's why, in order to defeat despair, I want you guys to fight alongside us!",20,6,0,138,138,,,
04865,Makoto,Trial 6,It's gonna be alright. Your real bodies have just been brainwashed.,20,6,0,139,139,,,
04866,Makoto,Trial 6,That's why... I'm pretty sure you'll quickly revert to the state you're in right now.,20,6,0,140,140,,,
04867,Makoto,Trial 6,I asked the same thing in the real world but nobody would give me an answer.,20,6,0,141,141,,,
04868,Makoto,Trial 6,"Even so, we kept trying over and over again until it was finally possible for us to enter the program...",20,6,0,142,142,,,
04869,Makoto,Trial 6,...just a short time ago.,20,6,0,143,143,,,
04870,Makoto,Trial 6,Th-that's just your imagination!,20,6,0,144,144,,,
04871,Makoto,Trial 6,It's true that we fell for this trap and that we run the risk of not being able to go back...,20,6,0,145,145,,,
04872,Makoto,Trial 6,...but what's wrong with that? Thinking that we'd back down because of something like that is a huge mistake!,20,6,0,146,146,,,
04873,Makoto,Trial 6,Huh?,20,6,0,147,147,,,
04874,Makoto,Trial 6,"Junko, I don't care what you say! I decided to believe in everyone!",20,6,0,148,148,,,
04875,Makoto,Trial 6,It's true that they walked the wrong path before but that's all in the past now.,20,6,0,149,149,,,
04876,Makoto,Trial 6,What I believe in is not their past but their futures!,20,6,0,150,150,,,
04877,Makoto,Trial 6,"No matter what you do to me, I will never fall into despair!",20,6,0,151,151,,,
04878,Makoto,Trial 6,How about it Kyoko?,20,6,0,152,152,,,
04879,Makoto,Trial 6,Liar! There's no way! There's no way Hajime is Izuru Kamukura!,20,6,0,153,153,,,
04880,Makoto,Trial 6,Could it be created hope?,20,6,0,154,154,,,
04881,Makoto,Trial 6,That might be Izuru...,20,6,0,155,155,,,
04882,Makoto,Trial 6,A while back I saw a file kept by the Future Foundation...,20,6,0,156,156,,,
04883,Makoto,Trial 6,"For many years, Hope's Peak Academy was researching a break-through plan to cultivate personal talent.",20,6,0,157,157,,,
04884,Makoto,Trial 6,Huh?,20,6,0,158,158,,,
04885,Makoto,Trial 6,"I-if you do that, everyone who died will be taken over by Junko's Alter Ego!",20,6,0,159,159,,,
04886,Makoto,Trial 6,Th-that's-!,20,6,0,160,160,,,
04887,Makoto,Trial 6,You can't believe her! That's how she works!,20,6,0,161,161,,,
04888,Makoto,Trial 6,"You guys, you can't buy into this! Think carefully about which is true hope!",20,6,0,162,162,,,
04889,Makoto,Trial 6,If everyone can overcome despair...,20,6,0,163,163,,,
04890,Makoto,Trial 6,...you guys should be able to grasp true hope!,20,6,0,164,164,,,
04891,Makoto,Trial 6,Huh?,20,6,0,165,165,,,
04892,Makoto,Trial 6,C-can't do it?,20,6,0,166,166,,,
04893,Makoto,Trial 6,H-Hajime!,20,6,0,167,167,,,
04894,Makoto,Trial 6,Th-that's-!,20,6,0,168,168,,,
04895,Makoto,Trial 6,You can't lose hope!,20,6,0,169,169,,,
04896,Makoto,Trial 6,Hajime... Everyone...,20,6,0,170,170,,,
04897,Makoto,Trial 6,Thank you.,20,6,0,171,171,,,
04898,Makoto,Trial 6,Huh?,20,6,0,172,172,,,
04899,Makoto,Trial 6,At least... this wasn't the ending prepared for them.,20,6,0,173,173,,,
04900,Makoto,Trial 6,This was the ending they created.,20,6,0,174,174,,,
04901,Makoto,Trial 6,"Regardless, there's no need for us to do anything.",20,6,0,175,175,,,
04902,Makoto,Trial 6,I got it!,20,6,0,176,176,,,
04903,Makoto,CG,Then... I guess we should get going.,20,99,0,101,101,,,
04904,Makoto,CG,I don't think that's the case.,20,99,0,102,102,,,
04905,Makoto,CG,"I mean, if they did turn back they wouldn't have said that they'd stay on this island.",20,99,0,103,103,,,
04906,Makoto,CG,I can't really say for sure but that's what I believe.,20,99,0,104,104,,,
04907,Makoto,CG,"No, the possibility isn't a problem.",20,99,0,105,105,,,
04908,Makoto,CG,"Even if there's the smallest possibility, they're still trying to create that future for themselves.",20,99,0,106,106,,,
04909,Makoto,CG,"In their eyes, that is the future!",20,99,0,107,107,,,
04910,Makoto,CG,"Strangely enough, I have a feeling that they'll be able to reach it.",20,99,0,108,108,,,
04911,Makoto,CG,"They've accepted their hopes and their despair, and they're trying to create their own future.",20,99,0,109,109,,,
04912,Makoto,CG,"Maybe, for people like that, miracles are inevitable. Don't you think?",20,99,0,110,110,,,
04913,Makoto,CG,Haven't grown up?,20,99,0,111,111,,,
04914,Makoto,CG,We need to work on concealing it.,20,99,0,112,112,,,
04915,Makoto,CG,U-umm... About that... I was gonna think about it while I was on the ship.,20,99,0,113,113,,,
04916,Makoto,CG,Huh? Why?,20,99,0,114,114,,,
04917,Makoto,CG,Fine.,20,99,0,115,115,,,
04918,Makoto,CG,Then let's go.,20,99,0,116,116,,,
04919,Makoto,CG,"We must create our own futures, too!",20,99,0,117,117,,,
04920,Chiaki,Trial 1,"Then, let's start with that mystery.",9,1,0,1,1,,,
04921,Chiaki,Trial 1,"Then, instead of knowing about it beforehand, maybe he saw it right at that moment.",9,1,0,2,2,,,
04922,Chiaki,Trial 1,"Like, for example, he might've seen someone trying to take the knife out from under the table.",9,1,0,3,3,,,
04923,Chiaki,Trial 1,It would be weird.,9,1,0,4,4,,,
04924,Chiaki,Trial 1,"They had to have already known, that's why they used the glowing paint as a mark.",9,1,0,5,5,,,
04925,Chiaki,Trial 1,"Regarding the energy usage, they probably used Monokuma about it.",9,1,0,6,6,,,
04926,Chiaki,Trial 1,That's wrong!,9,1,0,7,7,,,
04927,Chiaki,Trial 1,I think...,9,1,0,8,8,,,
04928,Chiaki,Trial 1,"Cuz, we've alread found a clue that might point to who the killer is.",9,1,0,9,9,,,
04929,Chiaki,Trial 1,"The killer? I dunno, but we do have a clue about a suspicious person... I think.",9,1,0,10,10,,,
04930,Chiaki,Trial 1,"First of all, let's try thinking about how the kiler was able to obtain the knife during the blackout.",9,1,0,11,11,,,
04931,Chiaki,Trial 1,"No, not that. I mean before that.",9,1,0,12,12,,,
04932,Chiaki,Trial 1,"And, there's only one person here who could've done that.",9,1,0,13,13,,,
04933,Chiaki,Trial 1,"But still, you had a chance, right? A chance to hide the knife under the table?",9,1,0,14,14,,,
04934,Chiaki,Trial 1,"If it was just one coincidence it'd be fine, but when it's one right after another...",9,1,0,15,15,,,
04935,Chiaki,Trial 1,"I wonder, is something like that even possible?",9,1,0,16,16,,,
04936,Chiaki,Trial 1,"I don't know if you're the killer or not but regardless, it proves that you're suspicious, right?",9,1,0,17,17,,,
04937,Chiaki,Trial 1,"by threatening Byakuya, Nagito was likely able to manipulate his actions.",9,1,0,18,18,,,
04938,Chiaki,Trial 1,"In doing so, Nagito was able to manipulate everyone to the scene where the murder would occur, am I wrong?",9,1,0,19,19,,,
04939,Chiaki,Trial 1,...,9,1,0,20,20,,,
04940,Chiaki,Trial 1,"Hey Nagito, are you still hiding something?",9,1,0,21,21,,,
04941,Chiaki,Trial 1,"Like, during the blackout, did something happen between you and Byakuya that we don't know about?",9,1,0,22,22,,,
04942,Chiaki,Trial 1,...,9,1,0,23,23,,,
04943,Chiaki,Trial 1,Maybe the killer didn't necessarily stab Byakuya under the table.,9,1,0,24,24,,,
04944,Chiaki,Trial 1,"But that doesn't mean where Byakuya got stabbed and where the killer did the stabbing are the same, right?",9,1,0,25,25,,,
04945,Chiaki,Trial 1,"Under the table, but not ""under"" the table. If it's somehow possible, it's the only way that makes sense.",9,1,0,26,26,,,
04946,Chiaki,Trial 1,"Moving forward, we should put aside all unnecessary preconceptions and just choose the answer... I think.",9,1,0,27,27,,,
04947,Chiaki,Trial 1,Then that has to be how the killer did it!,9,1,0,28,28,,,
04948,Chiaki,Trial 1,"If the space beneath the floor is empty, it's not that far to move from the storage room to the dining hall.",9,1,0,29,29,,,
04949,Chiaki,Trial 1,"I didn't participate but I was guarding the entrance, remember? Monomi over there can be my witness, right?",9,1,0,30,30,,,
04950,Chiaki,Trial 1,"Umm... Oh, you're right!",9,1,0,31,31,,,
04951,Chiaki,Trial 1,I saw Fuyuhiko after the party started. There's no way he could've been waiting under the floor before then.,9,1,0,32,32,,,
04952,Chiaki,Trial 1,"Well, if someone disappeared during the blackout no one would've noticed.",9,1,0,33,33,,,
04953,Chiaki,Trial 1,Is it really not possible?,9,1,0,34,34,,,
04954,Chiaki,Trial 1,"And in doing so, it might've been possible for them to use that mark to target the victim.",9,1,0,35,35,,,
04955,Chiaki,Trial 1,"But if they were able to do that, wouldn't that mean the killer knew about Nagito's plan all along?",9,1,0,36,36,,,
04956,Chiaki,Trial 1,...,9,1,0,37,37,,,
04957,Chiaki,Trial 1,"If Teruteru was in the dining hall during the blackout he should've been there after the power returned, right?",9,1,0,38,38,,,
04958,Chiaki,Trial 1,Why don't we consult his memories?,9,1,0,39,39,,,
04959,Chiaki,Trial 1,"Fine, I got it. Let's try thinking about what the weapon was.",9,1,0,40,40,,,
04960,Chiaki,Trial 1,"Also, I was on guard duty and I never once saw Teruteru leave the old building.",9,1,0,41,41,,,
04961,Chiaki,Trial 1,"I guess, we have no choice but oto somehow find out for ourselves.",9,1,0,42,42,,,
04962,Chiaki,Trial 1,"Check it out, the handle looks like it's made out of bone! Pretty clever.",9,1,0,43,43,,,
04963,Chiaki,Trial 1,"Hey Nagito, I'm sorry but can you just be quiet?",9,1,0,44,44,,,
04964,Chiaki,Trial 1,"I guess we need to settle this, once and for all.",9,1,0,45,45,,,
04965,Chiaki,Trial 1,"To do that, we need to go over the entire incident from beginning to end and make everything clear.",9,1,0,46,46,,,
04966,Chiaki,Trial 1,"Yeah, you're right. Then let's try discussing that first.",9,1,0,47,47,,,
04967,Chiaki,Trial 2,"So, I think it's better who the characters in the game are first.",9,2,0,1,1,,,
04968,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Ahh, ""a nasty, trashy pigshit"". I feel like I heard that in the game too.",9,2,0,2,2,,,
04969,Chiaki,Trial 2,...,9,2,0,3,3,,,
04970,Chiaki,Trial 2,Let's move on to Girl D.,9,2,0,4,4,,,
04971,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Anyway, now we've established who all the characters in the game are.",9,2,0,5,5,,,
04972,Chiaki,Trial 2,"If so, then Girl E is Miss Sato.",9,2,0,6,6,,,
04973,Chiaki,Trial 2,I don't know what Sato you're talking about but I don't think she's relevant to this case.,9,2,0,7,7,,,
04974,Chiaki,Trial 2,It's the murder that occurred in the music room. I knew it would come up so I prepared in advance.,9,2,0,8,8,,,
04975,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Look, I made a map of the music room's surrounding which was the stage of the first case.",9,2,0,9,9,,,
04976,Chiaki,Trial 2,Mapping is second nature to retro game fans.,9,2,0,10,10,,,
04977,Chiaki,Trial 2,Classic dungeon crawler RPGS have a first person point of view so mapping as you play is a basic-!,9,2,0,11,11,,,
04978,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Then, I'll start explaining.",9,2,0,12,12,,,
04979,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Girl A, Girl B, Girl C and Girl D were at the entrance hall when they heard the sound of glass breaking.",9,2,0,13,13,,,
04980,Chiaki,Trial 2,Immediately they climbed the stairs to the second floor and headed to where they heard that sound.,9,2,0,14,14,,,
04981,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Girl E was in front of the music room on the secon d floor, and she confirmed that the sound came from in there.",9,2,0,15,15,,,
04982,Chiaki,Trial 2,But the door to the music room was locked.,9,2,0,16,16,,,
04983,Chiaki,Trial 2,So Girl D went to get the key from the office. And when the five of them were finally able to get inside...,9,2,0,17,17,,,
04984,Chiaki,Trial 2,...they... found the victim's body dead from a blow to the head.,9,2,0,18,18,,,
04985,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Because the music room's window was broken, the girls thought that the killer escaped through there.",9,2,0,19,19,,,
04986,Chiaki,Trial 2,The sound of breaking glass that they heard in the entrance hall seemed to confirm that.,9,2,0,20,20,,,
04987,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Plus, Girl E's school swimsuit was stolen so they concluded that it was some pervert.",9,2,0,21,21,,,
04988,Chiaki,Trial 2,How does that sound?,9,2,0,22,22,,,
04989,Chiaki,Trial 2,She would've passed by the entrance hall where the other girls were waiting if she tried to do that.,9,2,0,23,23,,,
04990,Chiaki,Trial 2,To go back to the music room from outside...,9,2,0,24,24,,,
04991,Chiaki,Trial 2,...you need to go through the entrance hall.,9,2,0,25,25,,,
04992,Chiaki,Trial 2,So the sound of breaking glass that the four girls heard wasn't the music room's window.,9,2,0,26,26,,,
04993,Chiaki,Trial 2,"It was the sound of the vase breaking, probably.",9,2,0,27,27,,,
04994,Chiaki,Trial 2,But for the killer it's an idea that kills two birds with one stone.,9,2,0,28,28,,,
04995,Chiaki,Trial 2,"To make people think the killer was some pervert, it makes sense for a school swimsuit to be stolen.",9,2,0,29,29,,,
04996,Chiaki,Trial 2,"And if that swimsuit was used to make an improvised weaon, it had to be disposed of later.",9,2,0,30,30,,,
04997,Chiaki,Trial 2,"And, apparently the reason Girl E committed murder in the first place was to protect Girl D.",9,2,0,31,31,,,
04998,Chiaki,Trial 2,Girl D was being harrassed by the victim.,9,2,0,32,32,,,
04999,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Girl E found out and tried to stop it, and they ended up getting into an argument.",9,2,0,33,33,,,
05000,Chiaki,Trial 2,Then we can't assume Hiyoko is the one who dropped that yellow gummy.,9,2,0,34,34,,,
05001,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Let's assume Hiyoko is the killer, wouldn't that also mean she's the one that dragged the body?",9,2,0,35,35,,,
05002,Chiaki,Trial 2,"If she handled a body that bloody, I think her clothes and skin would've been stained with blood.",9,2,0,36,36,,,
05003,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Oh, wasn't changing inside the beach house prohibited in the first place?",9,2,0,37,37,,,
05004,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Yeah, seems like it.",9,2,0,38,38,,,
05005,Chiaki,Trial 2,A letter?,9,2,0,39,39,,,
05006,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Like this part, ""I was going to tell you in person but I couldn't find you so I put this in your mailbox"".",9,2,0,40,40,,,
05007,Chiaki,Trial 2,"This part, ""It seems there's someone who wants to interfere with our meeting"".",9,2,0,41,41,,,
05008,Chiaki,Trial 2,"And this part, ""Let's keep it a secret. Until then, let's try not to see each other for a while"".",9,2,0,42,42,,,
05009,Chiaki,Trial 2,The killer probably planned to frame Hiyoko from the start.,9,2,0,43,43,,,
05010,Chiaki,Trial 2,"And for that reason, they summoned Hiyoko before Mahiru, put her to sleep and shoved her inside the closet.",9,2,0,44,44,,,
05011,Chiaki,Trial 2,"If the killer was luring Hiyoko into a trap, then something that was used there might be a clue.",9,2,0,45,45,,,
05012,Chiaki,Trial 2,"No, it was probably the gummy.",9,2,0,46,46,,,
05013,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Hey, when you woke up, was the gummy already there?",9,2,0,47,47,,,
05014,Chiaki,Trial 2,Just as I thought!,9,2,0,48,48,,,
05015,Chiaki,Trial 2,"If the killer planted evidence while Hiyoko was there, she would've thrown it away if she found it.",9,2,0,49,49,,,
05016,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Hmm, I wonder...",9,2,0,50,50,,,
05017,Chiaki,Trial 2,"At any rate, the solution to that problem is connected to what really happened. That's what I think.",9,2,0,51,51,,,
05018,Chiaki,Trial 2,That's why the killer made sure to arrange a hiding place.,9,2,0,52,52,,,
05019,Chiaki,Trial 2,"But the shelf it was on, it was pretty messy, don't you think?",9,2,0,53,53,,,
05020,Chiaki,Trial 2,Two surfboards were stacked on the top shelf and there were surfboards that weren't even in a case.,9,2,0,54,54,,,
05021,Chiaki,Trial 2,The killer probably did that on purpose to secure a hiding place.,9,2,0,55,55,,,
05022,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Cuz we haven't been on this island that long so the closet shouldn't have been that messy, I think.",9,2,0,56,56,,,
05023,Chiaki,Trial 2,Maybe they simply washed it off.,9,2,0,57,57,,,
05024,Chiaki,Trial 2,They didn't have to use the shower.,9,2,0,58,58,,,
05025,Chiaki,Trial 2,If they used something other than the shower...,9,2,0,59,59,,,
05026,Chiaki,Trial 2,...maybe they were able to wash it off.,9,2,0,60,60,,,
05027,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Oh, you're right! These bottles look like they may have been filled with water.",9,2,0,61,61,,,
05028,Chiaki,Trial 2,...,9,2,0,62,62,,,
05029,Chiaki,Trial 2,We might have an answer.,9,2,0,63,63,,,
05030,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Well, if Peko is the killer then I might just have an answer to that mystery.",9,2,0,64,64,,,
05031,Chiaki,Trial 2,"First, let's establish how the killer escaped.",9,2,0,65,65,,,
05032,Chiaki,Trial 2,"No, they just have to use an object.",9,2,0,66,66,,,
05033,Chiaki,Trial 2,You did? I thought you were saying they couldn't dispose of an object?,9,2,0,67,67,,,
05034,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Well, it is a bamboo sword but I'm sure a slender girl like Peko could easily use it to climb.",9,2,0,68,68,,,
05035,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Uh, hold on. Let me confirm one thing first.",9,2,0,69,69,,,
05036,Chiaki,Trial 2,This is important and it relates to the voting. It's about Peko's motive.,9,2,0,70,70,,,
05037,Chiaki,Trial 2,"In the end, you had no connection to the events in Twilight Syndrome Murder Case, right?",9,2,0,71,71,,,
05038,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Then, why did you kill Mahiru?",9,2,0,72,72,,,
05039,Chiaki,Trial 2,...,9,2,0,73,73,,,
05040,Chiaki,Trial 2,So what's your answer to my previous question? Why did you kill Mahiru?,9,2,0,74,74,,,
05041,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Or, if you insist that you're Sparkling Justice, can you try saying that catchphrase in Spanish?",9,2,0,75,75,,,
05042,Chiaki,Trial 2,I see... That leaves us one person short.,9,2,0,76,76,,,
05043,Chiaki,Trial 2,I see... Now I finally see the connection. The connection between the motive and the incident.,9,2,0,77,77,,,
05044,Chiaki,Trial 2,That's a problem.,9,2,0,78,78,,,
05045,Chiaki,Trial 2,"If Peko's allegation holds up, that means our vote was incorrect.",9,2,0,79,79,,,
05046,Chiaki,Trial 2,"Anyway, we shouldn't proceed with the trial if those who can't participate in the arguments...",9,2,0,80,80,,,
05047,Chiaki,Trial 3,Since he's the first witness why don't we ask Hajime to explain the incident and the sequence of events?,9,3,0,1,1,,,
05048,Chiaki,Trial 3,But I remember feeling a little relieved because not long after we met up with Mikan and Fuyuhiko.,9,3,0,2,2,,,
05049,Chiaki,Trial 3,Did Hajime kill both of them?,9,3,0,3,3,,,
05050,Chiaki,Trial 3,"What a waste of time. Well, I knew it would turn out like this anyway.",9,3,0,4,4,,,
05051,Chiaki,Trial 3,"Yeah, I think so too.",9,3,0,5,5,,,
05052,Chiaki,Trial 3,It had a firm gel-like chewiness and I could smell workshop chemicals the moment I put it in my mouth.,9,3,0,6,6,,,
05053,Chiaki,Trial 3,"Based on all that, I'm certain it was glue.",9,3,0,7,7,,,
05054,Chiaki,Trial 3,"And thanks to that, a glob of glue was left where the door was stuck. Yup, it fits perfectly!",9,3,0,8,8,,,
05055,Chiaki,Trial 3,That doesn't really matter. The killer only did that to make us think the door was locked from the inside.,9,3,0,9,9,,,
05056,Chiaki,Trial 3,"First of all, didn't that drumstick we found seem really obvious? Almost unnaturally so?",9,3,0,10,10,,,
05057,Chiaki,Trial 3,It was so obvious that it makes more sense to think the killer placed it as a diversion.,9,3,0,11,11,,,
05058,Chiaki,Trial 3,But the killer made a mistake. They accidentally ripped off a piece of the wallpaper.,9,3,0,12,12,,,
05059,Chiaki,Trial 3,"And because of that, a scrap of that was left on the baton lighting.",9,3,0,13,13,,,
05060,Chiaki,Trial 3,"Yeah, it's valid. The condition on Ibuki's body suggests that as well.",9,3,0,14,14,,,
05061,Chiaki,Trial 3,I'm not even crying.,9,3,0,15,15,,,
05062,Chiaki,Trial 3,"Ohh, I see. You want me to explain it to you, right? Because I don't understand what I'm saying, right?",9,3,0,16,16,,,
05063,Chiaki,Trial 3,"Look, Ibuki died because she hanged herself, right",9,3,0,17,17,,,
05064,Chiaki,Trial 3,"That means, when she was still alive her feet were touching the floor.",9,3,0,18,18,,,
05065,Chiaki,Trial 3,"But, it seems Ibuki was still standing when Hiyoko was killed.",9,3,0,19,19,,,
05066,Chiaki,Trial 3,That would mean Hiyoko was killed before Ibuki.,9,3,0,20,20,,,
05067,Chiaki,Trial 3,Because she was doing something that was only possible if her feet were on the floor.,9,3,0,21,21,,,
05068,Chiaki,Trial 3,When Hiyoko died...,9,3,0,22,22,,,
05069,Chiaki,Trial 3,...Ibuki's feet were on the floor.,9,3,0,23,23,,,
05070,Chiaki,Trial 3,"When the killer tried to hide Hiyoko's body, they probably cleaned the blood at the same time but...",9,3,0,24,24,,,
05071,Chiaki,Trial 3,...Ibuki must have already stepped in it and the killer probably didn't even realize it.,9,3,0,25,25,,,
05072,Chiaki,Trial 3,Hiyoko's body was probably wrapped in duct tape to stop her bleeding.,9,3,0,26,26,,,
05073,Chiaki,Trial 3,"Yup, since we have all this evidence there's no one else who wants to object, right?",9,3,0,27,27,,,
05074,Chiaki,Trial 3,Then it's decided! Hiyoko was killed before Ibuki.,9,3,0,28,28,,,
05075,Chiaki,Trial 3,"But if Ibuki's the killer, she wouldn't have been able to falsify the sequence of the murders, right?",9,3,0,29,29,,,
05076,Chiaki,Trial 3,"After Hajime saw the hanged body, the sudden appearance of Hiyoko's body soon after means...",9,3,0,30,30,,,
05077,Chiaki,Trial 3,...the killer had to be alive at that time.,9,3,0,31,31,,,
05078,Chiaki,Trial 3,"And, if she was going to fake her death I think she wouldn't have chosen hanging.",9,3,0,32,32,,,
05079,Chiaki,Trial 3,Her body would've been defenseless in that state. If anyone touched her that alone would've ruined her plan.,9,3,0,33,33,,,
05080,Chiaki,Trial 3,"Uhh, but just to be sure: That surveillance camera doesn't have a record function, right?",9,3,0,34,34,,,
05081,Chiaki,Trial 3,I think everyone at the motel was doing that.,9,3,0,35,35,,,
05082,Chiaki,Trial 3,...,9,3,0,36,36,,,
05083,Chiaki,Trial 3,Too much info.,9,3,0,37,37,,,
05084,Chiaki,Trial 3,It's better if we think about it like that.,9,3,0,38,38,,,
05085,Chiaki,Trial 3,The killer decided to falsify the murder sequence to hide the time of the crime anyway.,9,3,0,39,39,,,
05086,Chiaki,Trial 3,But I'm thinking about it again and he's totally right! It feels incomplete.,9,3,0,40,40,,,
05087,Chiaki,Trial 3,"It's not just that. C'mon, try to remember the contents of the movie.",9,3,0,41,41,,,
05088,Chiaki,Trial 3,About the lion that got killed second...,9,3,0,42,42,,,
05089,Chiaki,Trial 3,"Hmm, even though we're calling it an imitation the lion actually got pinned by arrows, right?",9,3,0,43,43,,,
05090,Chiaki,Trial 3,But Hiyoko's body was suspended by common household duct tape.,9,3,0,44,44,,,
05091,Chiaki,Trial 3,Well that's probably it but that attitude is what makes this feel incomplete.,9,3,0,45,45,,,
05092,Chiaki,Trial 3,If falsifying the murder sequence was the killer's plan from the very beginning...,9,3,0,46,46,,,
05093,Chiaki,Trial 3,...they should've taken steps to properly imitate it.,9,3,0,47,47,,,
05094,Chiaki,Trial 3,"I'm saying, Hiyoko's murder wasn't.",9,3,0,48,48,,,
05095,Chiaki,Trial 3,"It's not just a poor imitation, there are also other strange details.",9,3,0,49,49,,,
05096,Chiaki,Trial 3,"Like, for example, why did Hiyoko go to the music venue?",9,3,0,50,50,,,
05097,Chiaki,Trial 3,"Hiyoko locked herself in her room because she was being overly cautious of the despair disease, you know?",9,3,0,51,51,,,
05098,Chiaki,Trial 3,I don't think a person like that would leave her room just because someone called for them.,9,3,0,52,52,,,
05099,Chiaki,Trial 3,"Then, the killer probably couldn't have assumed that Hiyoko would go to the music venue.",9,3,0,53,53,,,
05100,Chiaki,Trial 3,The only thing I can think of is it was an unfortunate coincidence.,9,3,0,54,54,,,
05101,Chiaki,Trial 3,"When she went to the venue by herself, she was probably just unlucky and walked in on the crime scene.",9,3,0,55,55,,,
05102,Chiaki,Trial 3,It probably happened when the killer was preparing to kill Ibuki.,9,3,0,56,56,,,
05103,Chiaki,Trial 3,"The killer most likely had already placed a hemp bag over her head, and without hesitation...",9,3,0,57,57,,,
05104,Chiaki,Trial 3,Because the killer used that coincidence for their crime it made this case even trickier.,9,3,0,58,58,,,
05105,Chiaki,Trial 3,Then what was the killer actually planning to do?,9,3,0,59,59,,,
05106,Chiaki,Trial 3,"They've been cunning this far, there's no way they'd kill Ibuki without a plan.",9,3,0,60,60,,,
05107,Chiaki,Trial 3,...,9,3,0,61,61,,,
05108,Chiaki,Trial 3,...,9,3,0,62,62,,,
05109,Chiaki,Trial 3,Unless there was something funny about that video.,9,3,0,63,63,,,
05110,Chiaki,Trial 3,"As long as I leave this to you, I won't do you to do your best but... Oh well, you should get started already.",9,3,0,64,64,,,
05111,Chiaki,Trial 3,Can you explain it to us?,9,3,0,65,65,,,
05112,Chiaki,Trial 3,It's possible those two stepladders were completely different.,9,3,0,66,66,,,
05113,Chiaki,Trial 3,Then one of the stepladders was somewhere other than the music venue.,9,3,0,67,67,,,
05114,Chiaki,Trial 3,"From what I remember, there used to be a really flashy curtain. But after the incident...",9,3,0,68,68,,,
05115,Chiaki,Trial 3,...it somehow became a plain black curtain that didn't seem to be the right size.,9,3,0,69,69,,,
05116,Chiaki,Trial 3,"In actuality, even though the curtain in the conference room doesn't stand out...",9,3,0,70,70,,,
05117,Chiaki,Trial 3,"...it is a black, light-blocking curtain that's long enough to reach the floor.",9,3,0,71,71,,,
05118,Chiaki,Trial 3,"But that's not all! There should be something else the killer did to tamper with the evidence, probably.",9,3,0,72,72,,,
05119,Chiaki,Trial 3,"If I'd found proof that evidence in the conference room was altered, we would've reached an answer sooner.",9,3,0,73,73,,,
05120,Chiaki,Trial 3,But it appears the killer already covered that up so I didn't find anything when I went there.,9,3,0,74,74,,,
05121,Chiaki,Trial 3,The actual time of death must've been earlier. Probably around midnight or dawn to avoid witnesses.,9,3,0,75,75,,,
05122,Chiaki,Trial 3,"Well, what do you know, Nagito?",9,3,0,76,76,,,
05123,Chiaki,Trial 3,"Though hanging and strangling seem similar, they're very different.",9,3,0,77,77,,,
05124,Chiaki,Trial 3,The scars they leave would look different too.,9,3,0,78,78,,,
05125,Chiaki,Trial 3,"Umm, I don't think belief and doubt are necessarily opposites.",9,3,0,79,79,,,
05126,Chiaki,Trial 3,"I do doubt her, but I still want to believe her. Belief lies at the heart of that conflict.",9,3,0,80,80,,,
05127,Chiaki,Trial 3,"Cuz, if there's no room for doubt then there's no reason to believe, is there?",9,3,0,81,81,,,
05128,Chiaki,Trial 3,"If you want to believe in someone, you need to overcome doubt first.",9,3,0,82,82,,,
05129,Chiaki,Trial 3,Belief without doubt is simply a lie.,9,3,0,83,83,,,
05130,Chiaki,Trial 3,"If we don't have any clues, why don't we have her give us some?",9,3,0,84,84,,,
05131,Chiaki,Trial 3,I'm... the same as Hajime. I don't want to doubt any of my friends.,9,3,0,85,85,,,
05132,Chiaki,Trial 3,"But still, the truth is one of us murdered two of our friends.",9,3,0,86,86,,,
05133,Chiaki,Trial 3,"That's why, we gotta stick with this until the very end so we can finally break these chains of despair.",9,3,0,87,87,,,
05134,Chiaki,Trial 3,"Hey Mikan, can I ask you one last thing?",9,3,0,88,88,,,
05135,Chiaki,Trial 3,"If you're not the killer, then who fabricated that video Hajime watched?",9,3,0,89,89,,,
05136,Chiaki,Trial 3,Can you prove it?,9,3,0,90,90,,,
05137,Chiaki,Trial 3,"Hmm, it seems she finally started arguing for us.",9,3,0,91,91,,,
05138,Chiaki,Trial 3,"But the only one who can find the hole in her argument is you, Hajime.",9,3,0,92,92,,,
05139,Chiaki,Trial 3,"So, I'm going to leave this to you once again.",9,3,0,93,93,,,
05140,Chiaki,Trial 3,"Hajime, pay close attention and l isten well.",9,3,0,94,94,,,
05141,Chiaki,Trial 3,You're the only one who can point out the killer's mistake.,9,3,0,95,95,,,
05142,Chiaki,Trial 3,"This is your just reward. The more desperately you argue, the deeper you dig yourself into a hole.",9,3,0,96,96,,,
05143,Chiaki,Trial 3,"You lied, didn't you?",9,3,0,97,97,,,
05144,Chiaki,Trial 4,The Body Discovery Announcement was made soon after. Akane heard that and rushed over.,9,4,0,1,1,,,
05145,Chiaki,Trial 4,"Now now, enough with the lover's quarell. We need to think about this seriously.",9,4,0,2,2,,,
05146,Chiaki,Trial 4,We don't have the luxury of discussing irrellevant things. The incident this time has many questions.,9,4,0,3,3,,,
05147,Chiaki,Trial 4,Why?,9,4,0,4,4,,,
05148,Chiaki,Trial 4,"Then, how about we look at it from a different angle?",9,4,0,5,5,,,
05149,Chiaki,Trial 4,"If it doesn't have oil on it, it's not the weapon. So whatever has oil on it must be the weapon, right?",9,4,0,6,6,,,
05150,Chiaki,Trial 4,I breifly considered that too but it's probably not what happened.,9,4,0,7,7,,,
05151,Chiaki,Trial 4,Is that really it?,9,4,0,8,8,,,
05152,Chiaki,Trial 4,"Hmm, we can't be certain of that either.",9,4,0,9,9,,,
05153,Chiaki,Trial 4,Not when the experiment involving the handbook I left on the tower floor was a complete success.,9,4,0,10,10,,,
05154,Chiaki,Trial 4,Hmm...,9,4,0,11,11,,,
05155,Chiaki,Trial 4,Hmmmm...,9,4,0,12,12,,,
05156,Chiaki,Trial 4,Strange scenery?,9,4,0,13,13,,,
05157,Chiaki,Trial 4,"The top floor, right?",9,4,0,14,14,,,
05158,Chiaki,Trial 4,It never occurred to us that they were the same building because it was structured with two different shapes.,9,4,0,15,15,,,
05159,Chiaki,Trial 4,"A quadrilateral and a hexagon, overlayed on top each other to misdirect how we would percieve them.",9,4,0,16,16,,,
05160,Chiaki,Trial 4,"And it worked, didn't it?",9,4,0,17,17,,,
05161,Chiaki,Trial 4,"Disregarding the tower, we fully believed the two houses were two separate, distinct buildings.",9,4,0,18,18,,,
05162,Chiaki,Trial 4,"It's alright, Kazuichi is not the killer.",9,4,0,19,19,,,
05163,Chiaki,Trial 4,"If he was, he wouldn't have fixed the elevator or the button in Strawberry Hall.",9,4,0,20,20,,,
05164,Chiaki,Trial 4,It'd be much more convenient for the killer if it stayed broken.,9,4,0,21,21,,,
05165,Chiaki,Trial 4,Maybe it was simply moved?,9,4,0,22,22,,,
05166,Chiaki,Trial 4,You can't think of a device like that? A device the moves things to different floors in the same building?,9,4,0,23,23,,,
05167,Chiaki,Trial 4,Remember when we entered the Funhouse from one side how we couldn't enter it from the other?,9,4,0,24,24,,,
05168,Chiaki,Trial 4,"That devide is just like that. If you enter it from a specific place, you can't enter it from the other.",9,4,0,25,25,,,
05169,Chiaki,Trial 4,"When you see people and things, make sure you focus on the good parts instead of the bad.",9,4,0,26,26,,,
05170,Chiaki,Trial 4,"Sooo, let's put aside what's changed and focus our attention on what hasn't.",9,4,0,27,27,,,
05171,Chiaki,Trial 4,"It's fine, c'mon! What does everything that hasn't changed have in common?",9,4,0,28,28,,,
05172,Chiaki,Trial 4,Aaand?,9,4,0,29,29,,,
05173,Chiaki,Trial 4,"Why did the picture on the far back door change? If you can figure that out, you'll have the answer.",9,4,0,30,30,,,
05174,Chiaki,Trial 4,The reason is because the elevator has something unique about it.,9,4,0,31,31,,,
05175,Chiaki,Trial 4,I want to say they lead outside but they're probably just for show.,9,4,0,32,32,,,
05176,Chiaki,Trial 4,So we'd falsely believe that the doors where connected to what their pictures signified.,9,4,0,33,33,,,
05177,Chiaki,Trial 4,"It was actually very effective. Because of that, we totally misunderstood the building's structure.",9,4,0,34,34,,,
05178,Chiaki,Trial 4,"Meaning, as the elevator moved between the two houses...",9,4,0,35,35,,,
05179,Chiaki,Trial 4,...it also rotated 180.,9,4,0,36,36,,,
05180,Chiaki,Trial 4,It... was probably following the building's perimeter as it rotated to the other side.,9,4,0,37,37,,,
05181,Chiaki,Trial 4,"Which means the exit would be on the opposite side once you arrived at the other house, right?",9,4,0,38,38,,,
05182,Chiaki,Trial 4,You know how the four-sided Strawberry House is on top of the six-sided Grape House?,9,4,0,39,39,,,
05183,Chiaki,Trial 4,"If you cut a four-sided shape out of a six-sided one, you get eight edges. It becomes an eight-sided shape!",9,4,0,40,40,,,
05184,Chiaki,Trial 4,...,9,4,0,41,41,,,
05185,Chiaki,Trial 4,I-I never... expected the Funhouse itself to be the Ultimate Weapon!,9,4,0,42,42,,,
05186,Chiaki,Trial 4,"Oh well, let's just press on ahead.",9,4,0,43,43,,,
05187,Chiaki,Trial 4,"I mean, that's not what's important. The thing that's really important is...",9,4,0,44,44,,,
05188,Chiaki,Trial 4,"...the killer who used the building's structure. Like, who's Nekomaru's murderer?",9,4,0,45,45,,,
05189,Chiaki,Trial 4,"Anyway, if the killer used the buildiing's structure, why don't we think about how they used it?",9,4,0,46,46,,,
05190,Chiaki,Trial 4,"It might be better if we clarify the cause of death first, don't you think?",9,4,0,47,47,,,
05191,Chiaki,Trial 4,"Then, how about this...",9,4,0,48,48,,,
05192,Chiaki,Trial 4,After locking Nekomaru inside the elevator...,9,4,0,49,49,,,
05193,Chiaki,Trial 4,...they moved the elevator from the fourth floor to the first floor...,9,4,0,50,50,,,
05194,Chiaki,Trial 4,...and made use of the drop.,9,4,0,51,51,,,
05195,Chiaki,Trial 4,That's what I was about to explain before Kazuichi interrupted me.,9,4,0,52,52,,,
05196,Chiaki,Trial 4,If you arrange it a certain way...,9,4,0,53,53,,,
05197,Chiaki,Trial 4,...you can cause the drop within the elevator.,9,4,0,54,54,,,
05198,Chiaki,Trial 4,That arrangement is...,9,4,0,55,55,,,
05199,Chiaki,Trial 4,"That's right, he was suspended in mid-air!",9,4,0,56,56,,,
05200,Chiaki,Trial 4,The killer tied up Nekomaru with the wire while he was in sleep mode...,9,4,0,57,57,,,
05201,Chiaki,Trial 4,...tied the tip of the wire into a knot and hung it on the door knob to the fourth floor.,9,4,0,58,58,,,
05202,Chiaki,Trial 4,"With that, they moved the elevator from the fourth floor to the first floor of Grape Tower...",9,4,0,59,59,,,
05203,Chiaki,Trial 4,...and suspended Nekomaru in mid-air.,9,4,0,60,60,,,
05204,Chiaki,Trial 4,If you woke up from an alarm and were realizing you were hanging upside down and had no clue why...,9,4,0,61,61,,,
05205,Chiaki,Trial 4,"...if something like that happened to you, you would start panicking a lot, right?",9,4,0,62,62,,,
05206,Chiaki,Trial 4,"Instinctively, your body would start moving. Nekomaru probably did exactly that.",9,4,0,63,63,,,
05207,Chiaki,Trial 4,Are there any clues that can be used to narrow that down?,9,4,0,64,64,,,
05208,Chiaki,Trial 4,Huh? You can tell?,9,4,0,65,65,,,
05209,Chiaki,Trial 4,Hmm... Alarm?,9,4,0,66,66,,,
05210,Chiaki,Trial 4,...,9,4,0,67,67,,,
05211,Chiaki,Trial 4,"To be honest, it's not just them. The same goes for me too.",9,4,0,68,68,,,
05212,Chiaki,Trial 4,"I was in a pretty deep sleep so I thought that's why I couldn't hear it, but...",9,4,0,69,69,,,
05213,Chiaki,Trial 4,...it wasn't that. I probably couldn't hear it at all.,9,4,0,70,70,,,
05214,Chiaki,Trial 4,Even though Mechamaru's murder was a death trap that utilized the alarm in his chest...,9,4,0,71,71,,,
05215,Chiaki,Trial 4,...the killer still needed to prepare the murder in advance.,9,4,0,72,72,,,
05216,Chiaki,Trial 4,"Which means they wouldn't have heard the alarm or the rumbling sound, thus proving they were in the room!",9,4,0,73,73,,,
05217,Chiaki,Trial 4,"If Gundham tried to hide and if those two went to his room to check on him, he would've been found out.",9,4,0,74,74,,,
05218,Chiaki,Trial 4,That would've been the worst possible outcome. That's why he couldn't just stay hidden.,9,4,0,75,75,,,
05219,Chiaki,Trial 4,Are you saying it was just a coincidence? Isn't that timing a little too perfect?,9,4,0,76,76,,,
05220,Chiaki,Trial 4,"If that's the case, they obviously know about the secret passage too, right?",9,4,0,77,77,,,
05221,Chiaki,Trial 4,"And, without such a risky plan they wouldn't have been able to lure him at all.",9,4,0,78,78,,,
05222,Chiaki,Trial 4,It's even more difficult if it's a one-on-one situation.,9,4,0,79,79,,,
05223,Chiaki,Trial 4,"Now that you mention it, after Ibuki was killed in the music venue...",9,4,0,80,80,,,
05224,Chiaki,Trial 4,"...one of Gundham's hamsters retrieved a piece of wallpaper from the baton lighting, right?",9,4,0,81,81,,,
05225,Chiaki,Trial 4,"Hey, with your friends and their exceptionally smart brains, it must have been possible...",9,4,0,82,82,,,
05226,Chiaki,Trial 4,...to secretely get one of them behind Nekomaru and press the button at the back of his neck!,9,4,0,83,83,,,
05227,Chiaki,Trial 5,What were they trying to find out by torturing him?,9,5,0,1,1,,,
05228,Chiaki,Trial 5,We don't need to play a game. It's clear the duct tape was on his mouth before the torture even began.,9,5,0,2,2,,,
05229,Chiaki,Trial 5,"You were with us when I peeled the duct tape off Nagito's mouth, right?",9,5,0,3,3,,,
05230,Chiaki,Trial 5,"The blood on Nagito's face wasn't under the duct tape, remember?",9,5,0,4,4,,,
05231,Chiaki,Trial 5,And the duct tape had a lot of crinkles around his mouth.,9,5,0,5,5,,,
05232,Chiaki,Trial 5,He must've been struggling to open his mouth under the duct tape.,9,5,0,6,6,,,
05233,Chiaki,Trial 5,Some kind of setup?,9,5,0,7,7,,,
05234,Chiaki,Trial 5,Some way?,9,5,0,8,8,,,
05235,Chiaki,Trial 5,"In place of those tiles, the killer used the Monokuma panels.",9,5,0,9,9,,,
05236,Chiaki,Trial 5,"So when we opened the warehouse door, the first panel toppled into the second.",9,5,0,10,10,,,
05237,Chiaki,Trial 5,"And from there, they fell like dominoes until they reached the lighter at the end.",9,5,0,11,11,,,
05238,Chiaki,Trial 5,"And one more thing, there was something else the killer did to hide the domino efect, right?",9,5,0,12,12,,,
05239,Chiaki,Trial 5,"But those sounds weren't the only strange thing, right?",9,5,0,13,13,,,
05240,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Looking back on it, it as also strange when we opened the door to the warehouse.",9,5,0,14,14,,,
05241,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Yeah, and that's how teh warehouse caught on fire! At least, that's how it looks.",9,5,0,15,15,,,
05242,Chiaki,Trial 5,"At the time, Akane mentioned that she could barely open the door.",9,5,0,16,16,,,
05243,Chiaki,Trial 5,"But the blocked doorway, there wasn't enough space for a person to fit through, right?",9,5,0,17,17,,,
05244,Chiaki,Trial 5,"It's a major problem! I mean, that door was the only entrance to the warehouse.",9,5,0,18,18,,,
05245,Chiaki,Trial 5,You don't have to think so hard. There's actually only one person who could've possibly done this.,9,5,0,19,19,,,
05246,Chiaki,Trial 5,"He wasn't justs the victim, maybe.",9,5,0,20,20,,,
05247,Chiaki,Trial 5,"He was the victim and he was the perpetrator too, maybe.",9,5,0,21,21,,,
05248,Chiaki,Trial 5,"But, Nagito might do something like that, don't you think?",9,5,0,22,22,,,
05249,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Yeah, you're right.",9,5,0,23,23,,,
05250,Chiaki,Trial 5,It seems we need to discuss how Nagito was able to tie himself up.,9,5,0,24,24,,,
05251,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Then Nagito's right arm wasn't tied up, right? He was able to move it freely, right?",9,5,0,25,25,,,
05252,Chiaki,Trial 5,Maybe he propped the knife somehow?,9,5,0,26,26,,,
05253,Chiaki,Trial 5,And slammed his right hand down on it?,9,5,0,27,27,,,
05254,Chiaki,Trial 5,Makes sense. That's why there was a big hole in the plushie's stomach.,9,5,0,28,28,,,
05255,Chiaki,Trial 5,"He inserted the knife handle into the hole to prop it up, then he slammed his hand onto it.",9,5,0,29,29,,,
05256,Chiaki,Trial 5,"If that's it, he had to place the plushie near him. And it also explains the mysterious blood on the plushie.",9,5,0,30,30,,,
05257,Chiaki,Trial 5,"After stabbing his hand, he no longer needed the plushie so he cast it off toward the fire's origin point.",9,5,0,31,31,,,
05258,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Like she said, in that condition it's very difficult to stab yourself with a spear.",9,5,0,32,32,,,
05259,Chiaki,Trial 5,"It'd be hard to use a spear with a knife stabbed into your right hand, while your left hand is tied up.",9,5,0,33,33,,,
05260,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,34,34,,,
05261,Chiaki,Trial 5,"But no matter what I think, I can't believe Nagito's death was caused by someone else.",9,5,0,35,35,,,
05262,Chiaki,Trial 5,"As Kazuichi said, it's true we've been constantly betrayed.",9,5,0,36,36,,,
05263,Chiaki,Trial 5,"But even if I'm betrayed again, I still want to believe in everyone.",9,5,0,37,37,,,
05264,Chiaki,Trial 5,"No matter how many times I may be betrayed, I still want to believe in everyone.",9,5,0,38,38,,,
05265,Chiaki,Trial 5,Do you really think so?,9,5,0,39,39,,,
05266,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,40,40,,,
05267,Chiaki,Trial 5,"I did say ""difficult"" but I never said ""impossible"".",9,5,0,41,41,,,
05268,Chiaki,Trial 5,I feel that there's... some way he could've stabbed himself with that spear.,9,5,0,42,42,,,
05269,Chiaki,Trial 5,I don't know.,9,5,0,43,43,,,
05270,Chiaki,Trial 5,It's impossible to figure out by myself. So let's think about it together.,9,5,0,44,44,,,
05271,Chiaki,Trial 5,That's how we made it this far up til now.,9,5,0,45,45,,,
05272,Chiaki,Trial 5,How did Nagito stab himself with a spear?,9,5,0,46,46,,,
05273,Chiaki,Trial 5,Let's work together and think this through!,9,5,0,47,47,,,
05274,Chiaki,Trial 5,Thatt settles the descption of that bloodstain but it's not the only unnatural bloodstain.,9,5,0,48,48,,,
05275,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Look, there's blood on the back of his hand. Around the middle joints of his fingers.",9,5,0,49,49,,,
05276,Chiaki,Trial 5,We might need to think and use our imaginations for a bit.,9,5,0,50,50,,,
05277,Chiaki,Trial 5,"If there's blood on his palm and the back of his hand, what was his left hand doing as the blood splattered?",9,5,0,51,51,,,
05278,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Now that you mention it, compared to the rest of his body the wounds on his arm are pretty mild.",9,5,0,52,52,,,
05279,Chiaki,Trial 5,He probably made his wounds mild on purpose so he could keep his strength while he gripped the spear.,9,5,0,53,53,,,
05280,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,54,54,,,
05281,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,55,55,,,
05282,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Oh, I got it! Maybe...",9,5,0,56,56,,,
05283,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Yeah, like I thought. It's no mistake that Nagito was gripping the spear, I think...",9,5,0,57,57,,,
05284,Chiaki,Trial 5,"However, what's important is what section of the spear he was gripping.",9,5,0,58,58,,,
05285,Chiaki,Trial 5,Isn't the size of that cut-off section about the same size as a human fist?,9,5,0,59,59,,,
05286,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,60,60,,,
05287,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,61,61,,,
05288,Chiaki,Trial 5,At a time like this...,9,5,0,62,62,,,
05289,Chiaki,Trial 5,"...how about we stick to ""The plan to think one step at a time instead of expecting the answers all at once""?",9,5,0,63,63,,,
05290,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Let's focus on the spear, first. Namely, where it was and how it was positioned just before it impaled Nagito.",9,5,0,64,64,,,
05291,Chiaki,Trial 5,"That' be awesome, but he probably used the ceiling girder directly above him.",9,5,0,65,65,,,
05292,Chiaki,Trial 5,I noticed a slight red streak on the ceiling girder. It probably got smeared there during the setup.,9,5,0,66,66,,,
05293,Chiaki,Trial 5,He... probably chose that spear so he could commit suicide like that.,9,5,0,67,67,,,
05294,Chiaki,Trial 5,"If someone else did this, there's no reason they'd go through all this trouble just to kill someone with a spear.",9,5,0,68,68,,,
05295,Chiaki,Trial 5,He probably covered his own mouth so we wouldn't hear him screaming in pain,9,5,0,69,69,,,
05296,Chiaki,Trial 5,The mystery isn't just about who the traitor is.,9,5,0,70,70,,,
05297,Chiaki,Trial 5,"No matter how you look at it, Nagito's death is a suicide, but...",9,5,0,71,71,,,
05298,Chiaki,Trial 5,"I'm a little worried, y'know? I'm worried about starting the mystery while there's still a mystery.",9,5,0,72,72,,,
05299,Chiaki,Trial 5,There's just one thing that doesn't make sense and it relates to Nagito's death.,9,5,0,73,73,,,
05300,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Plus, it's something even Nagito couldn't influence. He couldn't even tamper with the evidence for it.",9,5,0,74,74,,,
05301,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Yeah, that's it.",9,5,0,75,75,,,
05302,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Isn't that weird? Until now, the files always specified the cause of death.",9,5,0,76,76,,,
05303,Chiaki,Trial 5,"But even during Gundham's case, and before during Mikan's case...",9,5,0,77,77,,,
05304,Chiaki,Trial 5,...the thing he purposely omitted from the Monokuma File was always the most important mystery in the case.,9,5,0,78,78,,,
05305,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,79,79,,,
05306,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,80,80,,,
05307,Chiaki,Trial 5,"What should we do, you guys? Should we proceed with the vote?",9,5,0,81,81,,,
05308,Chiaki,Trial 5,I think we should keep going until everyone is satisfied. Even if it's just to be safe.,9,5,0,82,82,,,
05309,Chiaki,Trial 5,"We've come this far. Let's work hard to the very end. If we work together, everything should be alright.",9,5,0,83,83,,,
05310,Chiaki,Trial 5,That's what I believe.,9,5,0,84,84,,,
05311,Chiaki,Trial 5,Why don't we try removing all of our preconceived notions before we discuss this?,9,5,0,85,85,,,
05312,Chiaki,Trial 5,"In the beginning, our discussion advanced by assuming Nagito's death was caused by the spear.",9,5,0,86,86,,,
05313,Chiaki,Trial 5,"It's better to confirm if there are any other possibilities, that's what I think.",9,5,0,87,87,,,
05314,Chiaki,Trial 5,Hmm...,9,5,0,88,88,,,
05315,Chiaki,Trial 5,Hmmmm...,9,5,0,89,89,,,
05316,Chiaki,Trial 5,I feel like it's possible that we overlooked something.,9,5,0,90,90,,,
05317,Chiaki,Trial 5,There's no way he burned to death.,9,5,0,91,91,,,
05318,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Additionally, that's a poison made specifically for killing.",9,5,0,92,92,,,
05319,Chiaki,Trial 5,"I see. Now that you mention it, there's no way a toxin like that doesn't relate to the case at all!",9,5,0,93,93,,,
05320,Chiaki,Trial 5,"But, even if blood blotches appear, if the body was already covered in blood...",9,5,0,94,94,,,
05321,Chiaki,Trial 5,"...there's no way we'd notice them easily, right?",9,5,0,95,95,,,
05322,Chiaki,Trial 5,That's also a possibility.,9,5,0,96,96,,,
05323,Chiaki,Trial 5,"If there's no way he could've drank the poison, it might be impossible.",9,5,0,97,97,,,
05324,Chiaki,Trial 5,Just kidding. It's not like we're out of possibilities yet.,9,5,0,98,98,,,
05325,Chiaki,Trial 5,Since we've already ruled out so many possibilities it might be easier to to think about what really killed him.,9,5,0,99,99,,,
05326,Chiaki,Trial 5,Operation Elimination Method! The hint should be written on the poison's warning label. Maybe.,9,5,0,100,100,,,
05327,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Well, this was also written on the poison's warning label.",9,5,0,101,101,,,
05328,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Also, the poison is apparently denser than air. So it probably didn't affect us cz we were standing.",9,5,0,102,102,,,
05329,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,103,103,,,
05330,Chiaki,Trial 5,"If it meets the requirements that well, maybe it's not just a possibility anymore.",9,5,0,104,104,,,
05331,Chiaki,Trial 5,There might've been... an accomplice.,9,5,0,105,105,,,
05332,Chiaki,Trial 5,If Nagito committed suicide by inhaling poison that he brought...,9,5,0,106,106,,,
05333,Chiaki,Trial 5,...then why wasn't there anything that looked like poison at the crime scene?,9,5,0,107,107,,,
05334,Chiaki,Trial 5,"If Nagito brought poison to the warehouse, it's strange that we couldn't find it there.",9,5,0,108,108,,,
05335,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Yeah. If Nagito brought it, it's strange that we couldn't find that container anywher, right?",9,5,0,109,109,,,
05336,Chiaki,Trial 5,"It's probably plastic or glass, right? There's no way it'd completely incinerate.",9,5,0,110,110,,,
05337,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Even the plastic fragments of the fire grenades we used to put out the fire didn't completely burn up, you know?",9,5,0,111,111,,,
05338,Chiaki,Trial 5,Huh?,9,5,0,112,112,,,
05339,Chiaki,Trial 5,Hajime... Could it be?,9,5,0,113,113,,,
05340,Chiaki,Trial 5,Sonia's words are proof that the poison was swapped with the contents of a fire grenade.,9,5,0,114,114,,,
05341,Chiaki,Trial 5,There's more. That's not the only thing we found in Nagito's room.,9,5,0,115,115,,,
05342,Chiaki,Trial 5,"We also found a gas mask and gloves under his bed, too.",9,5,0,116,116,,,
05343,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,117,117,,,
05344,Chiaki,Trial 5,I admit that there wasn't an accomplice. That was just my misunderstanding.,9,5,0,118,118,,,
05345,Chiaki,Trial 5,"In actuality, the truth is even more horrifying!",9,5,0,119,119,,,
05346,Chiaki,Trial 5,"No, it's not!",9,5,0,120,120,,,
05347,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,121,121,,,
05348,Chiaki,Trial 5,I'm sorry but I just realized it.,9,5,0,122,122,,,
05349,Chiaki,Trial 5,We know Nagito used the grenade canister to store the poison...,9,5,0,123,123,,,
05350,Chiaki,Trial 5,...so when was it deployed in the warehouse? When did Nagito breathe in the poison?,9,5,0,124,124,,,
05351,Chiaki,Trial 5,"When I thought along those lines, that's when I realized it.",9,5,0,125,125,,,
05352,Chiaki,Trial 5,It probably... happened at the same time.,9,5,0,126,126,,,
05353,Chiaki,Trial 5,Yeah. I think so.,9,5,0,127,127,,,
05354,Chiaki,Trial 5,When we all threw the grenades to put out the fire in the warehouse...,9,5,0,128,128,,,
05355,Chiaki,Trial 5,...the poison was deployed and it converted to poison gas and killed Nagito.,9,5,0,129,129,,,
05356,Chiaki,Trial 5,"It would mean, he didn't kill himself.",9,5,0,130,130,,,
05357,Chiaki,Trial 5,"You mean who's the actual killer, right?",9,5,0,131,131,,,
05358,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,132,132,,,
05359,Chiaki,Trial 5,Who prepared the poisoned fire grenade that killed Nagito?,9,5,0,133,133,,,
05360,Chiaki,Trial 5,Then who set the warehouse fire that caused one of us to throw the poisoned grenade?,9,5,0,134,134,,,
05361,Chiaki,Trial 5,The next question will be my last. Considering all the facts up til now...,9,5,0,135,135,,,
05362,Chiaki,Trial 5,...why did Nagito set the warehouse on fire?,9,5,0,136,136,,,
05363,Chiaki,Trial 5,It was a trap!,9,5,0,137,137,,,
05364,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Preparing the poison, cretating a reason for us to throw the poison, it was all a setup by Nagito.",9,5,0,138,138,,,
05365,Chiaki,Trial 5,It was all a trap to make one of us throw the poison grenade.,9,5,0,139,139,,,
05366,Chiaki,Trial 5,I don't know. The person who threw it probably didn't know either.,9,5,0,140,140,,,
05367,Chiaki,Trial 5,"To do that, he set a trap to force someone to kill him.",9,5,0,141,141,,,
05368,Chiaki,Trial 5,The poisoned grenade and the fire were traps. That's why the curtain was the fire's origin point.,9,5,0,142,142,,,
05369,Chiaki,Trial 5,All the fire grenades we threw at the curtain shattered once they fell to the floor.,9,5,0,143,143,,,
05370,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Because of that, Nagito who was laying face up on the floor was able to breathe in the dense poison.",9,5,0,144,144,,,
05371,Chiaki,Trial 5,And then...,9,5,0,145,145,,,
05372,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Even so, the poison is what caused him to let go of the spear.",9,5,0,146,146,,,
05373,Chiaki,Trial 5,"No, it's too early to give up!",9,5,0,147,147,,,
05374,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,148,148,,,
05375,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Even though it's just a hunch, it's possible that it's probably...",9,5,0,149,149,,,
05376,Chiaki,Trial 5,There's one way! I think...,9,5,0,150,150,,,
05377,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,151,151,,,
05378,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Hey, is it alright if we look at Nagito's time one more time from the beginning?",9,5,0,152,152,,,
05379,Chiaki,Trial 5,I want to make sure my hunch is correct.,9,5,0,153,153,,,
05380,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Hajime, please.",9,5,0,154,154,,,
05381,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,155,155,,,
05382,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,156,156,,,
05383,Chiaki,Trial 5,What Hajime said is probably true. That's part of the reason why I thought it was a little strange.,9,5,0,157,157,,,
05384,Chiaki,Trial 5,Did Nagito really not care who the killer was?,9,5,0,158,158,,,
05385,Chiaki,Trial 5,He said this to us earlier...,9,5,0,159,159,,,
05386,Chiaki,Trial 5,That feeling of belief is at the heart of his trick.,9,5,0,160,160,,,
05387,Chiaki,Trial 5,"He believed we'd noticed the fire grenades, he believed we'd try to extinguish the flames...",9,5,0,161,161,,,
05388,Chiaki,Trial 5,...and he believed we'd fall into his trap.,9,5,0,162,162,,,
05389,Chiaki,Trial 5,"By believing in us, Nagito was able to put his life-threatening plan into effect.",9,5,0,163,163,,,
05390,Chiaki,Trial 5,"There's one more thing, remember? Something that Nagito believed in from the bottom of his heart.",9,5,0,164,164,,,
05391,Chiaki,Trial 5,I want you to try to remember what that is.,9,5,0,165,165,,,
05392,Chiaki,Trial 5,"But, in his case it was pretty remarkable, wasn't it? It almost seemed like he had blind faith in it.",9,5,0,166,166,,,
05393,Chiaki,Trial 5,I just thought it was strange that it doesn't connect to anything.,9,5,0,167,167,,,
05394,Chiaki,Trial 5,He factored in his belief in us but for some reason he didn#t factor in his own luck.,9,5,0,168,168,,,
05395,Chiaki,Trial 5,"No, there's no way. I mean, this is Nagito we're talking about.",9,5,0,169,169,,,
05396,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Y'know, he wasn't just after anybody.",9,5,0,170,170,,,
05397,Chiaki,Trial 5,He probably had a target. A target he was aiming for all along. A person to set up as the killer.,9,5,0,171,171,,,
05398,Chiaki,Trial 5,"The target's true identity, even Nagito didn't know it.",9,5,0,172,172,,,
05399,Chiaki,Trial 5,That's why he relied on being the Ultimate Lucky Student and incorporated that luck into his plan.,9,5,0,173,173,,,
05400,Chiaki,Trial 5,"As long as he had his luck, he believed the target he was after would pick up the fire grenade.",9,5,0,174,174,,,
05401,Chiaki,Trial 5,He probably risked his life just so his Ultimate Luck could decide this.,9,5,0,175,175,,,
05402,Chiaki,Trial 5,Nagito didn't know who the traitor was until the very end. All he could do was rely on his own luck.,9,5,0,176,176,,,
05403,Chiaki,Trial 5,That's probably true. By that point his plan should've already been in motion.,9,5,0,177,177,,,
05404,Chiaki,Trial 5,And that concludes my argument.,9,5,0,178,178,,,
05405,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Nagito's plan was to make the traitor kill him. What are you gonna do, are you guys gonna believe me?",9,5,0,179,179,,,
05406,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,180,180,,,
05407,Chiaki,Trial 5,"If... by chance... the traitor revealed themselves, during that bombscare? What would've happened?",9,5,0,181,181,,,
05408,Chiaki,Trial 5,Would it have... stopped Nagito from acting so reckless?,9,5,0,182,182,,,
05409,Chiaki,Trial 5,"But... they couldn't help it. Even if they wanted to reveal themselves, they couldn't do it.",9,5,0,183,183,,,
05410,Chiaki,Trial 5,Because... they weren't created to do that.,9,5,0,184,184,,,
05411,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,185,185,,,
05412,Chiaki,Trial 5,That's why... I want you guys to guess.,9,5,0,186,186,,,
05413,Chiaki,Trial 5,Yeah. I want you to guess.,9,5,0,187,187,,,
05414,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Who do you think it is, Hajime?",9,5,0,188,188,,,
05415,Chiaki,Trial 5,Who do you think the Future Foundation sent to infiltrate your group as the traitor?,9,5,0,189,189,,,
05416,Chiaki,Trial 5,A traitor who's not allowed to think that they're different from anyone else.,9,5,0,190,190,,,
05417,Chiaki,Trial 5,A traitor who can only interact with everyone as a traitor.,9,5,0,191,191,,,
05418,Chiaki,Trial 5,Because that's the nature of their existence. They can only exist as a traitor.,9,5,0,192,192,,,
05419,Chiaki,Trial 5,Who do you think... is the traitor?,9,5,0,193,193,,,
05420,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,194,194,,,
05421,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Hajime, please.",9,5,0,195,195,,,
05422,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,196,196,,,
05423,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Aww, you totally guessed right!",9,5,0,197,197,,,
05424,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Just as expected. Yup, you're correct.",9,5,0,198,198,,,
05425,Chiaki,Trial 5,I'm the traitor.,9,5,0,199,199,,,
05426,Chiaki,Trial 5,The agent sent by the Future Foundation sent to hide among you all... is me.,9,5,0,200,200,,,
05427,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,201,201,,,
05428,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,202,202,,,
05429,Chiaki,Trial 5,I'm sorry. It's the truth.,9,5,0,203,203,,,
05430,Chiaki,Trial 5,"No, I have nothing more to say.",9,5,0,204,204,,,
05431,Chiaki,Trial 5,Cuz we already know the killer's true identity.,9,5,0,205,205,,,
05432,Chiaki,Trial 5,So the only thing left to do is vote.,9,5,0,206,206,,,
05433,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,207,207,,,
05434,Chiaki,Trial 5,"It's definitely strange, right? Or rather, why was I able to do that?",9,5,0,208,208,,,
05435,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Maybe... I wanted to protect everyone, no matter the cost!",9,5,0,209,209,,,
05436,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,210,210,,,
05437,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Hey Hajime, can you do me a small favor?",9,5,0,211,211,,,
05438,Chiaki,Trial 5,I want you to prove to them that I'm the traitor.,9,5,0,212,212,,,
05439,Chiaki,Trial 5,"I want to explain everything to you guys but... as I expected, that's rather difficult.",9,5,0,213,213,,,
05440,Chiaki,Trial 5,That's why... the only thing I can do is plead with you.,9,5,0,214,214,,,
05441,Chiaki,Trial 5,I want you to do it. I believe you can prove it.,9,5,0,215,215,,,
05442,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,216,216,,,
05443,Chiaki,Trial 5,I'm very sorry. But this is the only way. So please...,9,5,0,217,217,,,
05444,Chiaki,Trial 5,Monomi?,9,5,0,218,218,,,
05445,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Hajime, you're going to listen to my request, right?",9,5,0,219,219,,,
05446,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,220,220,,,
05447,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,221,221,,,
05448,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Since I've been found out, I'll just confess.",9,5,0,222,222,,,
05449,Chiaki,Trial 5,The reason I couldn't tell anyone I knew the bomb was a fake was because... if I had said that...,9,5,0,223,223,,,
05450,Chiaki,Trial 5,...I would've had to explain how I heard about it from Monomi.,9,5,0,224,224,,,
05451,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Hey, can you listen to me a little?",9,5,0,225,225,,,
05452,Chiaki,Trial 5,"There's nothing to be sad about, you know? Cuz this is different from what happened before.",9,5,0,226,226,,,
05453,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Unlike before, you guys don't have to stay alive by doubting someone.",9,5,0,227,227,,,
05454,Chiaki,Trial 5,You guys can stay alive by believing in me.,9,5,0,228,228,,,
05455,Chiaki,Trial 5,I'm sorry.,9,5,0,229,229,,,
05456,Chiaki,Trial 5,"Monomi, I'm sorry too.",9,5,0,230,230,,,
05457,Chiaki,Trial 5,You're probably gonna get scolded by a lot of different people for this.,9,5,0,231,231,,,
05458,Chiaki,Trial 5,"But still, I want to protect everyone by any means.",9,5,0,232,232,,,
05459,Chiaki,Trial 5,"And, I'm happy that I'm able to do that.",9,5,0,233,233,,,
05460,Chiaki,Trial 5,...,9,5,0,234,234,,,
05461,Chiaki,Trial 5,"I know. It's voting time, right?",9,5,0,235,235,,,
05462,Chiaki,Trial 5,You don't have to worry. Believe in me and cast your vote.,9,5,0,236,236,,,
05463,Chiaki,Trial 6,An eternal game utopia sounds like fun!,9,6,0,1,1,,,
05464,Chiaki,Trial 6,That's not it.,9,6,0,2,2,,,
05465,Chiaki,Trial 6,"You guys aren't part of the game, right?",9,6,0,3,3,,,
05466,Chiaki,Trial 6,"I'm just a part of the game but you guys aren't, right?",9,6,0,4,4,,,
05467,Chiaki,Trial 6,Hmm... I don't know.,9,6,0,5,5,,,
05468,Chiaki,Trial 6,...,9,6,0,6,6,,,
05469,Chiaki,Trial 6,...,9,6,0,7,7,,,

05472,Chiaki,Trial 6,"Even if I cease to exist, even if you guys never remember me again...",9,6,0,10,10,,,
05473,Chiaki,Trial 6,...that doesn't mean I will completely disappear.,9,6,0,11,11,,,
05474,Chiaki,Trial 6,As long as everyone continues to move forward toward the future we created together...,9,6,0,12,12,,,
05475,Chiaki,Trial 6,...I will never disappear.,9,6,0,13,13,,,
05476,Chiaki,Trial 6,"What I lived for, fought for and risked my life for will still exist.",9,6,0,14,14,,,
05477,Chiaki,Trial 6,"You're...  probably just scared, right?",9,6,0,15,15,,,
05478,Chiaki,Trial 6,"Not just of disappearing. You're scared of moving toward the future with such a heavy burden, right?",9,6,0,16,16,,,
05479,Chiaki,Trial 6,How much longer are you going to be this indecisive?,9,6,0,17,17,,,
05480,Chiaki,Trial 6,Didn't you want to become someone with confidence? Isn't that why you admired Hope's Peak Academy?,9,6,0,18,18,,,
05481,Chiaki,Trial 6,Hajime. You've had it wrong this whole time!,9,6,0,19,19,,,
05482,Chiaki,Trial 6,Having talent isn't the goal!,9,6,0,20,20,,,
05483,Chiaki,Trial 6,"There's something much more important than whether or not you have talent, right?",9,6,0,21,21,,,
05484,Chiaki,Trial 6,What's important is that you believe in yourself.,9,6,0,22,22,,,
05485,Chiaki,Trial 6,"If you can't do that, no matter how much talent you possess, you will never be confident in yourself.",9,6,0,23,23,,,
05486,Chiaki,Trial 6,Just like... how you were in the past.,9,6,0,24,24,,,
05487,Chiaki,Trial 6,But past Hajime is in the past.,9,6,0,25,25,,,
05488,Chiaki,Trial 6,He's not the same Hajime who spent time with me and the others in this world.,9,6,0,26,26,,,
05489,Chiaki,Trial 6,So it's going to be alright. I think it's time you finally had confidence in yourself.,9,6,0,27,27,,,
05490,Chiaki,Trial 6,"You guys are the only ones who have the right to decide your future, and thre responsibility too.",9,6,0,28,28,,,
05491,Chiaki,Trial 6,"But if you can't choose either future, why don't you just create one?",9,6,0,29,29,,,

05495,Chiaki,Trial 6,You guys have a tremendous ultimate move that can overcome anything.,9,6,0,33,33,,,
05496,Chiaki,Trial 6,"I guess what I'm trying to say is... if  you just do it, things will turn out okay!",9,6,0,34,34,,,
05497,Chiaki,Trial 6,"Of course, games aren't very fun when they're easy to clear.",9,6,0,35,35,,,
05498,Chiaki,Trial 6,"Hey, Hajime.",9,6,0,36,36,,,
05499,Chiaki,Trial 6,This isn't for the sake of anyone else. You... you  have to do this for yourself.,9,6,0,37,37,,,
05500,Chiaki,Trial 6,"Now then, it's about time you show me your cool side, Hajime.",9,6,0,38,38,,,
05501,Chiaki,Trial 6,"C'mon, I'll help out too.",9,6,0,39,39,,,
05502,Chiaki,Trial 6,"See? If you just do it, things will turn out okay!",9,6,0,40,40,,,
05503,Chiaki,Trial 6,You should even be able to create the future.,9,6,0,41,41,,,

05593,Chiaki,Game,Hmm...,9,99,0,80,80,,,
05594,Chiaki,CG,I assume freshmen like us have been gathered in this classroom.,9,99,0,101,101,,,
05595,Chiaki,CG,"Umm, we're just checking to see if we can get under the floor from here.",9,99,0,102,102,,,
05596,Chiaki,CG,"If it is possible to get under the floor, it will change our understanding of the murder... I think.",9,99,0,103,103,,,
05597,Chiaki,CG,"So I thought, it was important to check it.",9,99,0,104,104,,,
05598,Chiaki,CG,"My my, how disappointing. I thought if I came early I'd be the first one to arrive.",9,99,0,105,105,,,
05599,Chiaki,CG,"I didn't wanna carry it with me. If I did, it'd be a serious burden.",9,99,0,106,106,,,
05600,Chiaki,CG,"Instead of bringing lunch for everyone, I brought ice cream!",9,99,0,107,107,,,
05601,Chiaki,CG,"Also, I was thinking of stuff we could all do at the beach together so I brought a board game too!",9,99,0,108,108,,,
05602,Chiaki,CG,I see. That's disappointing...,9,99,0,109,109,,,
05603,Chiaki,CG,"Umm, Nekomaru?",9,99,0,110,110,,,
05604,Chiaki,CG,Haven't you... noticed it yourself?,9,99,0,111,111,,,

05606,Chiaki,CG,"You wouldn't do something like that, right? You're not the kind of person who would hurt someone.",9,99,0,113,113,,,
05607,Chiaki,CG,Right?,9,99,0,114,114,,,
05608,Chiaki,CG,"See, it's alright. Yep, no problem.",9,99,0,115,115,,,
05609,Chiaki,CG,Looks like there aren't any lights on. Is Nagito really in here?,9,99,0,116,116,,,

05613,Chiaki,CG,"Details about our missing memories, information about the time we spent at Hope's Peak Academy.",9,99,0,120,120,,,
05614,Chiaki,CG,Hmm... If it's not written in there...,9,99,0,121,121,,,
05615,Chiaki,CG,...these profiles might've been written before we entered the academy.,9,99,0,122,122,,,
05616,Chiaki,CG,"Yeah, seems like it.",9,99,0,123,123,,,
05617,Chiaki,CG,Hmm? Who are you talking about?,9,99,0,124,124,,,

05630,Chiaki,CG,Cuz... I know.,9,99,0,137,137,,,
05631,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"What, you think he was killed under the table?",6,1,0,1,1,,,
05632,Nekomaru,Trial 1,Th-that does make sense but... Why did he go under the table?,6,1,0,2,2,,,
05633,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"It's a blackout, not an earthquake. Just cause the power went out doesn't mean he'd dive under the table.",6,1,0,3,3,,,
05634,Nekomaru,Trial 1,Wha-? You seem rather confident about that.,6,1,0,4,4,,,
05635,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"Though Byakuya was thorough, even he couldn't have noticed a weapon taped to the underside of a table.",6,1,0,5,5,,,
05636,Nekomaru,Trial 1,That's true. He went above and beyond being a little cautious.,6,1,0,6,6,,,
05637,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"Gah, he should've told us he received a threatening letter.",6,1,0,7,7,,,
05638,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"Even if the knife bore some sort, it would've been difficult to see it in that darkness.",6,1,0,8,8,,,
05639,Nekomaru,Trial 1,What happened to your guard duty!?,6,1,0,9,9,,,
05640,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"It's true, someone was occupying the bathroom for a long time shortly after the party started.",6,1,0,10,10,,,
05641,Nekomaru,Trial 1,And it was finally freed up after Byakuya's body was discovered.,6,1,0,11,11,,,
05642,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"If she locked herself in the bathroom for that long, there's no doubt. It's shit!",6,1,0,12,12,,,
05643,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"Gahahahahahaha! Ah, there's no way she'd admit it! There's no way she'd admit she was taking a shit!",6,1,0,13,13,,,
05644,Nekomaru,Trial 1,Gh-! I'm sorry.,6,1,0,14,14,,,
05645,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"Don't worry, the smell wasn't that strong. I used the bathroom right after you so can trust me.",6,1,0,15,15,,,
05646,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"Hold on a second, let me speak too!",6,1,0,16,16,,,
05647,Nekomaru,Trial 1,You say the irons in the storage room were used to trigger the blackout?,6,1,0,17,17,,,
05648,Nekomaru,Trial 1,That's inexcusable!,6,1,0,18,18,,,
05649,Nekomaru,Trial 1,If the irons in the storage room caused the blackout...,6,1,0,19,19,,,
05650,Nekomaru,Trial 1,...then for the killer to turn the irons on...,6,1,0,20,20,,,
05651,Nekomaru,Trial 1,...you're saying they went all the way to the storage room?,6,1,0,21,21,,,
05652,Nekomaru,Trial 1,Then that means everyone who was in the dining hall...,6,1,0,22,22,,,
05653,Nekomaru,Trial 1,...when the blackout occurred can't be a suspect.,6,1,0,23,23,,,
05654,Nekomaru,Trial 1,But the people in the dining hall weren't able to cause the blackout.,6,1,0,24,24,,,
05655,Nekomaru,Trial 1,If the irons caused the blackout...,6,1,0,25,25,,,
05656,Nekomaru,Trial 1,...then the killer had to go to the storage room before that...,6,1,0,26,26,,,
05657,Nekomaru,Trial 1,...and turn on the irons!,6,1,0,27,27,,,
05658,Nekomaru,Trial 1,Now do you intend to take back what you said?,6,1,0,28,28,,,
05659,Nekomaru,Trial 1,A-air conditioners!?,6,1,0,29,29,,,
05660,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"I see. When the timers activated the air conditioners, the breakers tripped and caused a blackout.",6,1,0,30,30,,,
05661,Nekomaru,Trial 1,I see! I understand! Indubitably!,6,1,0,31,31,,,
05662,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"Which means, the only one who could've felt their way to the table using the power cord using the table was... Nagito!",6,1,0,32,32,,,
05663,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"Now that you mention it, Nagito did prepare the drawing to pick who cleaned the dining hall...",6,1,0,33,33,,,
05664,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"If that's the case, that strange speech earlier... That was part of your plan too.",6,1,0,34,34,,,
05665,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"Hey Nagito, if you were behind all of this, then did you also send that threatening letter?",6,1,0,35,35,,,
05666,Nekomaru,Trial 1,Y-you're not making any sense!,6,1,0,36,36,,,
05667,Nekomaru,Trial 1,How can that be? We spent all this time talking back and forth!,6,1,0,37,37,,,
05668,Nekomaru,Trial 1,You mean after the lights came back on? What would he have done if we'd seen him?,6,1,0,38,38,,,
05669,Nekomaru,Trial 1,Ghh! Man up and speak more clearly!,6,1,0,39,39,,,
05670,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"I see. If they passed through the storage room, I understand why the tablecloth was put there.",6,1,0,40,40,,,
05671,Nekomaru,Trial 1,What if they used a string like the cord?,6,1,0,41,41,,,
05672,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"Hmph! You're obviously the killer, right?",6,1,0,42,42,,,
05673,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"Ahh, by using the glowing paint as a target they were able to judge where to stab even in the dark!",6,1,0,43,43,,,
05674,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"Well, Teruteru?",6,1,0,44,44,,,
05675,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"Well, it's not that far to move along the wall from the kitchen to the dining hall...",6,1,0,45,45,,,
05676,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"Ghh, is there any way we can decide?",6,1,0,46,46,,,
05677,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"Weapon, huh? It's not the knife, right?",6,1,0,47,47,,,
05678,Nekomaru,Trial 1,So that missing iron skewer is the weapon!?,6,1,0,48,48,,,
05679,Nekomaru,Trial 1,"Teruteru, just man up and be straight with us.",6,1,0,49,49,,,
05680,Nekomaru,Trial 1,What now!?,6,1,0,50,50,,,
05681,Nekomaru,Trial 1,What are you doing? Hurry up and bring it over!,6,1,0,51,51,,,
05682,Nekomaru,Trial 2,S-some of us are characters in a video game!?,6,2,0,1,1,,,
05683,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Hold on, why do you keep saying there were two Kuzuryus?",6,2,0,2,2,,,
05684,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Nagito, you seem to be doubting Fuyuhiko a lot. Do you suspect he's the killer?",6,2,0,3,3,,,
05685,Nekomaru,Trial 2,We get it! Let's talk about that later so we can focus on the case!,6,2,0,4,4,,,
05686,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Obviously, Girl E was waiting outside the music room for the other girls after she killed the first vicitm.",6,2,0,5,5,,,
05687,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Which means, Girl E was hiding that key. We can assume she used it to lock the music room after she left it.",6,2,0,6,6,,,
05688,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"You can lock the music room from the inside, right? So from there, Girl E broke the window and escaped...",6,2,0,7,7,,,
05689,Nekomaru,Trial 2,...and sprinted to the front of the music room as fast as she could before the others arrived!,6,2,0,8,8,,,
05690,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Th-then, forget this!",6,2,0,9,9,,,
05691,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"At the entrance hall, the girls...",6,2,0,10,10,,,
05692,Nekomaru,Trial 2,...heard the sound of the window shattering...,6,2,0,11,11,,,
05693,Nekomaru,Trial 2,...to make them think the murder had just occurred and that the killer had just escaped!,6,2,0,12,12,,,
05694,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Fine, let's figure out the weapon. If this keeps up, I'm gonna feel like I need to shit!",6,2,0,13,13,,,
05695,Nekomaru,Trial 2,Which means I'll feel disgusting!,6,2,0,14,14,,,
05696,Nekomaru,Trial 2,That's too big to be a weapon!,6,2,0,15,15,,,
05697,Nekomaru,Trial 2,Why are you going even bigger?,6,2,0,16,16,,,
05698,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"It's on that big a scale, too?",6,2,0,17,17,,,
05699,Nekomaru,Trial 2,And she felt a rush of anger and ended up killing her...,6,2,0,18,18,,,
05700,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Hey, clear this up for me. Those of you who appared as characters in the game, do you remember this incident?",6,2,0,19,19,,,
05701,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Are you saying, when that person went inside the beach house the body hadn't appeared yet?",6,2,0,20,20,,,
05702,Nekomaru,Trial 2,She's probably faking it.,6,2,0,21,21,,,
05703,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Hiyoko, why don't you just admit it already? You're being unreasonably stubborn!",6,2,0,22,22,,,
05704,Nekomaru,Trial 2,There's no doubt...,6,2,0,23,23,,,
05705,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"...you went to the beach house, right?",6,2,0,24,24,,,
05706,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"It's true, that's an important piece of evidence.",6,2,0,25,25,,,
05707,Nekomaru,Trial 2,And we can thank Mahiru for it!,6,2,0,26,26,,,
05708,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"I can attest to that. If I hadn't gotten that rough with her, she never would've backed down.",6,2,0,27,27,,,
05709,Nekomaru,Trial 2,I would like to know too. It might lead to some kinda clue.,6,2,0,28,28,,,
05710,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"So, what was your answer to Mahiru's invitation?",6,2,0,29,29,,,
05711,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Whoa, the meeting times are off!",6,2,0,30,30,,,
05712,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"That seems very likely. In fact, if you compare both letters...",6,2,0,31,31,,,
05713,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Confirmed, just as I assumed! The handwriting is the same! The content of the letters matches too!",6,2,0,32,32,,,
05714,Nekomaru,Trial 2,This will never end if you keep being so suspicious!,6,2,0,33,33,,,
05715,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Yeah, we need to figure out who Mahiru's killer is.",6,2,0,34,34,,,
05716,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Which means, the gummy was placed inside the closet after Hiyoko fled from the beach house?",6,2,0,35,35,,,
05717,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Don't you mean, ""It's always darkest under the lighthouse""?",6,2,0,36,36,,,
05718,Nekomaru,Trial 2,You're the one who went on a tangent!,6,2,0,37,37,,,
05719,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Now that you mention it, that mystery hasn't been solved yet...",6,2,0,38,38,,,
05720,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"As someone who flushes their shit every morning, I can declare...",6,2,0,39,39,,,
05721,Nekomaru,Trial 2,...it would definitely clog the toilet!,6,2,0,40,40,,,
05722,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Of course not, that would violate a school trip rule!",6,2,0,41,41,,,
05723,Nekomaru,Trial 2,A-are you saying she used that bamboo sword to escape through the window?,6,2,0,42,42,,,
05724,Nekomaru,Trial 2,Y-you-! What are you saying?,6,2,0,43,43,,,
05725,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"P-Peko, what are you doing?",6,2,0,44,44,,,
05726,Nekomaru,Trial 2,I-I don't get it but... but this is becoming... really crazy!,6,2,0,45,45,,,
05727,Nekomaru,Trial 2,Th-then... the reason you killed Mahiru was...,6,2,0,46,46,,,
05728,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Gahhh, I can't stand this anymore! Let's just end this farce already!",6,2,0,47,47,,,
05729,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Monokuma, the vote! Hurry up and let us vote already!",6,2,0,48,48,,,
05730,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Strange, what do you mean? There's no doubt that Peko is the killer.",6,2,0,49,49,,,
05731,Nekomaru,Trial 2,From Spain!?,6,2,0,50,50,,,
05732,Nekomaru,Trial 2,"Hey, be clearer! We're asking you what your purpose was!",6,2,0,51,51,,,
05733,Nekomaru,Trial 2,So that means there was one more person in the beach house!,6,2,0,52,52,,,
05734,Nekomaru,Trial 2,H-how would Peko be a tool in the first place?,6,2,0,53,53,,,
05735,Nekomaru,Trial 2,Peko is a legitimate human being!,6,2,0,54,54,,,

05896,Akane,Trial 2,"Hmm? What do you mean, little sister?",8,2,0,1,1,,,
05897,Akane,Trial 2,Maybe it's related to Gundham's last name since they're both really plain names!,8,2,0,2,2,,,
05898,Akane,Trial 2,Isn't the cause of death a blow to the head?,8,2,0,3,3,,,
05899,Akane,Trial 2,"Girl D... You're talking about Mahiru, right?",8,2,0,4,4,,,
05900,Akane,Trial 2,"I see. If you went there during your morning walk, that doesn't have anything to do with the case at all.",8,2,0,5,5,,,

05902,Akane,Trial 2,"You're the one who wore that mask and killed Mahiru, right?",8,2,0,7,7,,,
05903,Akane,Trial 2,Mahiru used her last ounce of strength and...,8,2,0,8,8,,,
05904,Akane,Trial 2,...blocked the door to the road. Thanks to her...,8,2,0,9,9,,,
05905,Akane,Trial 2,...we have the evidence we need!,8,2,0,10,10,,,
05906,Akane,Trial 2,Instant death?,8,2,0,11,11,,,
05907,Akane,Trial 2,"Oh yeah, she couldn't even tie her sash on her own. That's why she couldn't take a bath and smelled bad.",8,2,0,12,12,,,
05908,Akane,Trial 2,Didn't I tell you that was because I got beat up by Coach Nekomaru?,8,2,0,13,13,,,

05911,Akane,Trial 2,We can just slightly punch him to death later.,8,2,0,16,16,,,
05912,Akane,Trial 2,Huh? Candy can be a clue?,8,2,0,17,17,,,
05913,Akane,Trial 2,"Seriously, nobody asked what you think.",8,2,0,18,18,,,

05916,Akane,Trial 2,"Oh, you shut up. Then, grit your teeth!",8,2,0,21,21,,,
05917,Akane,Trial 2,She might've reached it by riding someone's shoulders but then that person would've been left behind.,8,2,0,22,22,,,
05918,Akane,Trial 2,You see? I knew it! I knew it was a ninja! Didn't I tell you? A ninja could have climbed that easily!,8,2,0,23,23,,,
05919,Akane,Trial 2,Ninjas know a climbing trick where they lean their sword against a wall and use the handguard as a stepstool.,8,2,0,24,24,,,
05920,Akane,Trial 2,An ally of justice? So that's why you're wearing a mask!,8,2,0,25,25,,,
05921,Akane,Trial 2,She's like... totally cool with it!,8,2,0,26,26,,,
05922,Akane,Trial 2,"But even if it's the motive, it's just a game, right? There's no reason to believe it's even true.",8,2,0,27,27,,,
05923,Akane,Trial 2,Would you call a game like that a strong motive?,8,2,0,28,28,,,
05924,Akane,Trial 2,"H-hey, wh-what's going on? Can anyone give me a simpler explanation?",8,2,0,29,29,,,
05925,Akane,Trial 2,What the hell!?,8,2,0,30,30,,,
05926,Akane,Trial 3,But Nagito's not alone. I don't really get it either.,8,3,0,1,1,,,
05927,Akane,Trial 3,"Empty head? Huh, what's wrong with that?",8,3,0,2,2,,,
05928,Akane,Trial 3,"Listen up, the emptier your head the more dreams you can stuff inside it, y'know?",8,3,0,3,3,,,
05929,Akane,Trial 3,"So this means Ibuki definitely climbed the stepladder all by herself, right?",8,3,0,4,4,,,
05930,Akane,Trial 3,Then that seals it! Ibuki committed suicide!,8,3,0,5,5,,,
05931,Akane,Trial 3,"Hmm, a murder coincidentally occurring in the same place as a suicide... ain't possible, huh?",8,3,0,6,6,,,
05932,Akane,Trial 3,"Hmm? What do you mean, a closed room?",8,3,0,7,7,,,
05933,Akane,Trial 3,Are you talking about the broken drum stick?,8,3,0,8,8,,,
05934,Akane,Trial 3,I didn't know glue was edible!,8,3,0,9,9,,,
05935,Akane,Trial 3,"And they also taped her up after killing her, right?",8,3,0,10,10,,,
05936,Akane,Trial 3,And what's wrong with that? Does it have something to do with Hiyoko's body disappearing?,8,3,0,11,11,,,
05937,Akane,Trial 3,But why did the killer go through all this trouble in the first place?,8,3,0,12,12,,,
05938,Akane,Trial 3,Then it's Hiyoko's blood!,8,3,0,13,13,,,
05939,Akane,Trial 3,"Plus, Ibuki's body was left out in the open and it wasn't bleeding from any open wounds at all.",8,3,0,14,14,,,
05940,Akane,Trial 3,"Huh? Again? Didn't something like this happen last time, too?",8,3,0,15,15,,,
05941,Akane,Trial 3,Wh-what the heck?,8,3,0,16,16,,,
05942,Akane,Trial 3,Don't say it all proud...,8,3,0,17,17,,,
05943,Akane,Trial 3,And what about the others?,8,3,0,18,18,,,
05944,Akane,Trial 3,"I get it, you guys have alibis.",8,3,0,19,19,,,
05945,Akane,Trial 3,"Maaan, this again...",8,3,0,20,20,,,
05946,Akane,Trial 3,Strange details? Like what?,8,3,0,21,21,,,
05947,Akane,Trial 3,If that's not it...,8,3,0,22,22,,,
05948,Akane,Trial 3,...maybe she got abducted by the killer!,8,3,0,23,23,,,
05949,Akane,Trial 3,There's no way she got abducted?,8,3,0,24,24,,,
05950,Akane,Trial 3,"The killer could've locked her door, right? Just to hide the fact that Hiyoko got abducted!",8,3,0,25,25,,,
05951,Akane,Trial 3,Are you saying my gut was wrong?,8,3,0,26,26,,,
05952,Akane,Trial 3,This could be my first and last highlight of the day! Why won't you just lemme shine already?,8,3,0,27,27,,,
05953,Akane,Trial 3,"Shut up! Enough with your fancy talk, I'll shut you up right now!",8,3,0,28,28,,,
05954,Akane,Trial 3,"Hiyoko was locked inside her room, right?",8,3,0,29,29,,,
05955,Akane,Trial 3,She definitely got abducted or something!,8,3,0,30,30,,,
05956,Akane,Trial 3,The killer forced herself to Hiyoko's room and...,8,3,0,31,31,,,
05957,Akane,Trial 3,...forcibly abducted her!,8,3,0,32,32,,,
05958,Akane,Trial 3,The girl was so small and weak lookin'.,8,3,0,33,33,,,
05959,Akane,Trial 3,And that's why the killer targeted her!,8,3,0,34,34,,,
05960,Akane,Trial 3,The killer was the one who locked the door!,8,3,0,35,35,,,
05961,Akane,Trial 3,So what if the key was in her kimono?,8,3,0,36,36,,,
05962,Akane,Trial 3,Maybe the killer just put it there later.,8,3,0,37,37,,,
05963,Akane,Trial 3,"Hold on, try remembering Hiyoko's body.",8,3,0,38,38,,,
05964,Akane,Trial 3,Her kimono was all messed up!,8,3,0,39,39,,,
05965,Akane,Trial 3,There's only one reason her kimono would be that messed up...,8,3,0,40,40,,,
05966,Akane,Trial 3,...she fought the killer!,8,3,0,41,41,,,
05967,Akane,Trial 3,"That's the proof she was abducted, right?",8,3,0,42,42,,,
05968,Akane,Trial 3,My gut is totally right after all!,8,3,0,43,43,,,
05969,Akane,Trial 3,Wear her kimono?,8,3,0,44,44,,,
05970,Akane,Trial 3,Then the reason her kimono was messed up wasn't because she fought the killer...,8,3,0,45,45,,,
05971,Akane,Trial 3,"I-I get it, I lost. Boil me, burn me, take off my clothes! Do whatever you want to me!",8,3,0,46,46,,,
05972,Akane,Trial 3,C-coincidence?,8,3,0,47,47,,,
05973,Akane,Trial 3,Huh? What are you talking about?,8,3,0,48,48,,,
05974,Akane,Trial 3,Huh? There weren't?,8,3,0,49,49,,,
05975,Akane,Trial 3,What do you mean?,8,3,0,50,50,,,
05976,Akane,Trial 3,"That means, you should've realized that from the start and made this easier on all of us.",8,3,0,51,51,,,
05977,Akane,Trial 3,But the hospital and the music venue look completely different.,8,3,0,52,52,,,
05978,Akane,Trial 3,I still can't believe he mixed up the filming locations...,8,3,0,53,53,,,
05979,Akane,Trial 3,"Hajime, you're pretty stupid!",8,3,0,54,54,,,
05980,Akane,Trial 3,"Matching floors, matching curtains... I guess it makes sense you'd mistake the two.",8,3,0,55,55,,,
05981,Akane,Trial 3,"Umm, if Ibuki's hanging video was filmed at the hospital's conference room...",8,3,0,56,56,,,
05982,Akane,Trial 3,...then was Ibuki killed at the conference room too?,8,3,0,57,57,,,
05983,Akane,Trial 3,"H-hey, don't you think that's kinda impossible?",8,3,0,58,58,,,
05984,Akane,Trial 3,"A chick like her is the killer? She couldn't even kill a fly. In fact, the fly would probably kill her first.",8,3,0,59,59,,,
05985,Akane,Trial 3,"Hey, you sure this chick is really the killer?",8,3,0,60,60,,,
05986,Akane,Trial 3,"Hey, Hajime!",8,3,0,61,61,,,
05987,Akane,Trial 3,"Dang, that's a huge deal!",8,3,0,62,62,,,
05988,Akane,Trial 3,Again with the supermarket? That place is a hotspot for criminal goods.,8,3,0,63,63,,,
05989,Akane,Trial 3,"Hey, you're taking too long! What's wrong with the rope being frayed?",8,3,0,64,64,,,
05990,Akane,Trial 3,That's basically the same thing.,8,3,0,65,65,,,
05991,Akane,Trial 3,Mikan nursed me til I got better. There's no way I'm gonna doubt her.,8,3,0,66,66,,,
05992,Akane,Trial 3,Huh?,8,3,0,67,67,,,
05993,Akane,Trial 3,S-so Mikan volunteered to nurse us cause she was planning to do this all along?,8,3,0,68,68,,,
05994,Akane,Trial 3,You're freaking annoying! If you keep talking I'm seriously gonna beat you up!,8,3,0,69,69,,,
05995,Akane,Trial 3,S-stop it already! That's enough!,8,3,0,70,70,,,
05996,Akane,Trial 3,O-!,8,3,0,71,71,,,
05997,Akane,Trial 3,Y-you doubt your friends?,8,3,0,72,72,,,
05998,Akane,Trial 3,Wh-what the hell does that mean?,8,3,0,73,73,,,
05999,Akane,Trial 3,Huh?,8,3,0,74,74,,,
06000,Akane,Trial 3,D-don't say deep stuff. I... don't really get it.,8,3,0,75,75,,,
06001,Akane,Trial 3,Tch...,8,3,0,76,76,,,
06002,Akane,Trial 3,"Fine, do whatever you want. I won't stop you anymore.",8,3,0,77,77,,,
06003,Akane,Trial 3,O-!,8,3,0,78,78,,,
06004,Akane,Trial 3,Are... you serious?,8,3,0,79,79,,,
06005,Akane,Trial 3,"Is it true, Mikan? Did you kill Hiyoko and Ibuki?",8,3,0,80,80,,,
06006,Akane,Trial 3,This... chick. Has she lost it for good?,8,3,0,81,81,,,
06007,Akane,Trial 4,I'm here today because Coach Nekomaru risked his life to protect me.,8,4,0,1,1,,,
06008,Akane,Trial 4,I'm gonna be the one who avenges him. I'll definitely find out who the killer is!,8,4,0,2,2,,,
06009,Akane,Trial 4,"I-I'm definitely not tempted by curry, got it?",8,4,0,3,3,,,
06010,Akane,Trial 4,"With legs like those, I could probably do the splits real easy!",8,4,0,4,4,,,
06011,Akane,Trial 4,"Forget these boring intros, let's talk about the killer!",8,4,0,5,5,,,
06012,Akane,Trial 4,"Anyway, it's definitely someone from Strawberry House.",8,4,0,6,6,,,
06013,Akane,Trial 4,There's no way a chick would kill someone so cruelly! So it must be one of you Strawberry House dudes.,8,4,0,7,7,,,
06014,Akane,Trial 4,One of you better hurry up and confess! Or I'll break all of you in half!,8,4,0,8,8,,,
06015,Akane,Trial 4,"That pillar, huh?",8,4,0,9,9,,,
06016,Akane,Trial 4,"You're pretty insightful, Baby Gangster!",8,4,0,10,10,,,
06017,Akane,Trial 4,Then that pillar is the weapon! Coach Nekomaru got clobbered with that pillar!,8,4,0,11,11,,,
06018,Akane,Trial 4,Wh-why?,8,4,0,12,12,,,
06019,Akane,Trial 4,"Yeah, that pillar was pretty freakin' heavy.",8,4,0,13,13,,,
06020,Akane,Trial 4,But there's one dude who coulda lifted that pillar.,8,4,0,14,14,,,
06021,Akane,Trial 4,"Coach Nekomaru's robot body! With that dude's super strength, lifting a pillar would be real easy.",8,4,0,15,15,,,
06022,Akane,Trial 4,"Don't be stupid, he ain't the type to commit suicide!",8,4,0,16,16,,,
06023,Akane,Trial 4,Gh-!,8,4,0,17,17,,,
06024,Akane,Trial 4,"Well, I guess you're right...",8,4,0,18,18,,,
06025,Akane,Trial 4,Huh? For reals?,8,4,0,19,19,,,
06026,Akane,Trial 4,I see! So my gut was right after all.,8,4,0,20,20,,,
06027,Akane,Trial 4,"Alright, it's up to you, Sonia. Proof that pillar was the murder weapon!",8,4,0,21,21,,,
06028,Akane,Trial 4,"Sonia, you go girl!",8,4,0,22,22,,,
06029,Akane,Trial 4,"Hehe, I'm getting hella excited!",8,4,0,23,23,,,
06030,Akane,Trial 4,If they didn't tip it over then how did the killer murder Nekomaru with that pillar?,8,4,0,24,24,,,
06031,Akane,Trial 4,Th-there's no way I can let it go! I'm positive that Nekomaru got killed by that pillar!,8,4,0,25,25,,,
06032,Akane,Trial 4,I just... have a feeling.,8,4,0,26,26,,,
06033,Akane,Trial 4,Who cares? Just tell us how the pillar was used to kill!,8,4,0,27,27,,,
06034,Akane,Trial 4,Huh? The secret of the Funhouse?,8,4,0,28,28,,,
06035,Akane,Trial 4,It's weird to say they're both the same place...,8,4,0,29,29,,,
06036,Akane,Trial 4,"...I mean, the walls are different colors!",8,4,0,30,30,,,
06037,Akane,Trial 4,And the designs on the floor are also different.,8,4,0,31,31,,,
06038,Akane,Trial 4,So what really happened? Does that mean the two towers aren't the same building?,8,4,0,32,32,,,
06039,Akane,Trial 4,"Yeah, the e-Handbook was still there. That's why we thought the two towers were the same building.",8,4,0,33,33,,,
06040,Akane,Trial 4,But how do we know your hint is any good? It's suspicious that you're the only one who knows it.,8,4,0,34,34,,,
06041,Akane,Trial 4,"Umm, Strawberry House is four-sided and Grape House is six-sided, right?",8,4,0,35,35,,,
06042,Akane,Trial 4,You mean a fake body?,8,4,0,36,36,,,
06043,Akane,Trial 4,The body moved to a different floor!?,8,4,0,37,37,,,
06044,Akane,Trial 4,"Where the hell is this elevator, anyway?",8,4,0,38,38,,,
06045,Akane,Trial 4,"I see, we were basically waiting for the room to arrive just like an elevator!",8,4,0,39,39,,,
06046,Akane,Trial 4,Only the floor moved?,8,4,0,40,40,,,
06047,Akane,Trial 4,"Then, where do the differen floors lead?",8,4,0,41,41,,,
06048,Akane,Trial 4,I don't get it. But I guess it means whoever designed that building had a totally twisted personality.,8,4,0,42,42,,,
06049,Akane,Trial 4,Why?,8,4,0,43,43,,,
06050,Akane,Trial 4,"So we're done with the secret of the Funhouse, right? Then let's start talking about the important stuff!",8,4,0,44,44,,,
06051,Akane,Trial 4,What's the Ultimate Weapon that killed Nekomaru? And how'd they combine it with the pillar?,8,4,0,45,45,,,
06052,Akane,Trial 4,Then the Ultimate Weapon was there too?,8,4,0,46,46,,,
06053,Akane,Trial 4,Re...tract?,8,4,0,47,47,,,
06054,Akane,Trial 4,"It's fine, let's just leave him alone and find out who killed Coach Nekomaru as fast as we can!",8,4,0,48,48,,,
06055,Akane,Trial 4,"Just so you know, it's not like I'm getting hungry or anything, y'know?",8,4,0,49,49,,,
06056,Akane,Trial 4,Are you saying they pushed him off? Where'd they push him off from?,8,4,0,50,50,,,
06057,Akane,Trial 4,It might be possible in the tower.,8,4,0,51,51,,,
06058,Akane,Trial 4,You could push him off the fourth floor while the elevator is on the first floor!,8,4,0,52,52,,,
06059,Akane,Trial 4,"Hmm, but my gut is going crazy right now.",8,4,0,53,53,,,
06060,Akane,Trial 4,When the elvator is on the first floor...,8,4,0,54,54,,,
06061,Akane,Trial 4,"...you can't go through the door on the fourth floor, huh...",8,4,0,55,55,,,
06062,Akane,Trial 4,Isn't it about time we went over the pillar again?,8,4,0,56,56,,,
06063,Akane,Trial 4,"But Nekomaru didn't fall because the wire came off, right?",8,4,0,57,57,,,
06064,Akane,Trial 4,"Finally, the pillar!",8,4,0,58,58,,,
06065,Akane,Trial 4,"See, I told you the pillar was the weapon! My gut was totally right!",8,4,0,59,59,,,
06066,Akane,Trial 4,"Hold on, Baby Gangster!",8,4,0,60,60,,,
06067,Akane,Trial 4,What'd you just say? Did you say the alarm was set for 7:30 AM?,8,4,0,61,61,,,
06068,Akane,Trial 4,"Nah, that's impossible.",8,4,0,62,62,,,
06069,Akane,Trial 4,"Cuz, even though I slept in a little I still got to the tower at 7 in the morning.",8,4,0,63,63,,,
06070,Akane,Trial 4,And if we found Nekomaru's body there it would've been before the 7:30 alarm went off.,8,4,0,64,64,,,
06071,Akane,Trial 4,Th-that's what I wanna know!,8,4,0,65,65,,,
06072,Akane,Trial 4,The killer probably did some tamperin'!,8,4,0,66,66,,,
06073,Akane,Trial 4,They probably messed with the clock inside Nekomaru's chest!,8,4,0,67,67,,,
06074,Akane,Trial 4,That's gotta be it!,8,4,0,68,68,,,
06075,Akane,Trial 4,So you're saying there's no way the killer could've tampered with the clock?,8,4,0,69,69,,,
06076,Akane,Trial 4,I never misunderstand! I'll crush you into dog food!,8,4,0,70,70,,,
06077,Akane,Trial 4,"Now's not the time to be please. More importantly, how much was the time off?",8,4,0,71,71,,,
06078,Akane,Trial 4,He's not the type to let out a scream!,8,4,0,72,72,,,
06079,Akane,Trial 4,I thought it was just an earthquake so I went back to sleep! Was that the sound from when Nekomaru fell?,8,4,0,73,73,,,
06080,Akane,Trial 4,I heard that sound... probably around 5:30 in the morning.,8,4,0,74,74,,,
06081,Akane,Trial 4,"I instantly woke up and left my room, and that's when I saw the clock in the lounge.",8,4,0,75,75,,,
06082,Akane,Trial 4,T-two hours? That much?,8,4,0,76,76,,,
06083,Akane,Trial 4,Really? Was there anyone who didn't have an alibi at that time?,8,4,0,77,77,,,
06084,Akane,Trial 4,Who is it? Who's the bastard?,8,4,0,78,78,,,
06085,Akane,Trial 4,"If you don't hurry up and answer, I'm gonna suicide-dive you!",8,4,0,79,79,,,
06086,Akane,Trial 4,Couldn't hear it? What does that mean?,8,4,0,80,80,,,
06087,Akane,Trial 4,H-hold on a sec! Why does that lead to who the killer is?,8,4,0,81,81,,,
06088,Akane,Trial 4,But why'd you come out? You should've hid until the excitement died down.,8,4,0,82,82,,,
06089,Akane,Trial 4,Huh?,8,4,0,83,83,,,
06090,Akane,Trial 4,And what's wrong with that?,8,4,0,84,84,,,
06091,Akane,Trial 4,Or there was a secret passageway...,8,4,0,85,85,,,
06092,Akane,Trial 4,"Meaning, the third floor and the fourth floor are actually connected!",8,4,0,86,86,,,
06093,Akane,Trial 4,"Th-that might be true, but...",8,4,0,87,87,,,
06094,Akane,Trial 4,I don't understand anything. What does that mean?,8,4,0,88,88,,,
06095,Akane,Trial 4,It's not easy to get the drop on Coach Nekomaru!,8,4,0,89,89,,,
06096,Akane,Trial 4,Stop... Stop it already...,8,4,0,90,90,,,
06097,Akane,Trial 4,Stop using weird words to avoid the truth...,8,4,0,91,91,,,
06098,Akane,Trial 4,Or I'll freaking kill you myself!,8,4,0,92,92,,,
06099,Akane,Trial 5,So that's why he was so beat up!,8,5,0,1,1,,,
06100,Akane,Trial 5,"If so, the suspect...",8,5,0,2,2,,,
06101,Akane,Trial 5,...is whoever found the bomb first!,8,5,0,3,3,,,
06102,Akane,Trial 5,Who cares about the duct tape? We might as well settle this with Rock-Paper-Scissors...,8,5,0,4,4,,,
06103,Akane,Trial 5,"If so, it's freakin' crazy! Did they go psycho or something?",8,5,0,5,5,,,
06104,Akane,Trial 5,Hmm? The warehouse fire was for destroying evidence?,8,5,0,6,6,,,
06105,Akane,Trial 5,"Yeah, and right after I opened the warehouse door the flames started burning from the very back!",8,5,0,7,7,,,
06106,Akane,Trial 5,Some kind of setup? Like what?,8,5,0,8,8,,,
06107,Akane,Trial 5,They probably just thre the lighter!,8,5,0,9,9,,,
06108,Akane,Trial 5,Maybe they used invisible thread!,8,5,0,10,10,,,
06109,Akane,Trial 5,A domino effect. You mean those tiles kids play with by lining them up and tipping them over?,8,5,0,11,11,,,
06110,Akane,Trial 5,That's it! So the strange sound was actually the sound of the panels falling!,8,5,0,12,12,,,
06111,Akane,Trial 5,"Ahh, so the door was being blocked by a Monokuma panel!",8,5,0,13,13,,,
06112,Akane,Trial 5,"Because the panel was blocking it, right?",8,5,0,14,14,,,
06113,Akane,Trial 5,Does that mean they were hiding in sight?,8,5,0,15,15,,,
06114,Akane,Trial 5,"Wh-why'd you bring him up? He's the victim, y'know?",8,5,0,16,16,,,
06115,Akane,Trial 5,Huh?,8,5,0,17,17,,,
06116,Akane,Trial 5,How about if you use your teeth?,8,5,0,18,18,,,
06117,Akane,Trial 5,Or if you use your front tail?,8,5,0,19,19,,,
06118,Akane,Trial 5,"Hajime, that's awesome! I'll let ya cop a feel if you want!",8,5,0,20,20,,,
06119,Akane,Trial 5,"Fine, I just gotta get a Benjamin from him before I let him touch me, right?",8,5,0,21,21,,,
06120,Akane,Trial 5,"Hajime, you-you tricked me! Give me back that Benjamin!",8,5,0,22,22,,,
06121,Akane,Trial 5,"If it's something lame, I'll make you give back the Benjamin with 10,000% interest!",8,5,0,23,23,,,
06122,Akane,Trial 5,Is he a throwing knife expert?,8,5,0,24,24,,,
06123,Akane,Trial 5,Propped it onto what?,8,5,0,25,25,,,
06124,Akane,Trial 5,"But for a moment, I seriously thought Monokuma died or something...",8,5,0,26,26,,,
06125,Akane,Trial 5,"Then, he probably took the spear first and as he endured the pain he stabbed the knife into his right hand!",8,5,0,27,27,,,
06126,Akane,Trial 5,So you're saying it's impossible.,8,5,0,28,28,,,
06127,Akane,Trial 5,You don't know.,8,5,0,29,29,,,
06128,Akane,Trial 5,He used his teeth?,8,5,0,30,30,,,
06129,Akane,Trial 5,Or maybe he used his front tail!,8,5,0,31,31,,,
06130,Akane,Trial 5,I know guys have tails that get hard when they're grabbed!,8,5,0,32,32,,,
06131,Akane,Trial 5,"When the blood splattered, that's as far as it reached, right?",8,5,0,33,33,,,
06132,Akane,Trial 5,"Like you said, it looks like an unnatrual bloodstain but... What's wrong with that?",8,5,0,34,34,,,
06133,Akane,Trial 5,Was he grabbin' his front tail?,8,5,0,35,35,,,
06134,Akane,Trial 5,"At times like this, you should always strike from a good angle. Just like fixing an old TV!",8,5,0,36,36,,,
06135,Akane,Trial 5,"Ah, you're right! So this is the part Nagito was gripping, huh...",8,5,0,37,37,,,
06136,Akane,Trial 5,And then... the blood that was supposed to end up here...,8,5,0,38,38,,,
06137,Akane,Trial 5,...ended up getting on Nagito's left hand!,8,5,0,39,39,,,
06138,Akane,Trial 5,Hmm...,8,5,0,40,40,,,
06139,Akane,Trial 5,That's a long plan name.,8,5,0,41,41,,,
06140,Akane,Trial 5,So you're saying he needed to use that spear to pull off his trick.,8,5,0,42,42,,,
06141,Akane,Trial 5,"Did he put the duct tape on his mouth, too?",8,5,0,43,43,,,
06142,Akane,Trial 5,Did he want us to die that bad?,8,5,0,44,44,,,
06143,Akane,Trial 5,"Hmm, that should be okay, right? Right?",8,5,0,45,45,,,
06144,Akane,Trial 5,"No, I agree that Nagito killed himself but... I feel like there's something that doesn't make sense.",8,5,0,46,46,,,
06145,Akane,Trial 5,It's probably just my imagination...,8,5,0,47,47,,,
06146,Akane,Trial 5,"Well, there's no doubt Nagito's death was a suicide. Oh well, I guess my gut is wrong sometimes.",8,5,0,48,48,,,
06147,Akane,Trial 5,"H-hey, what do you mean it's not about who the traitor is? What kinda mystery is left?",8,5,0,49,49,,,
06148,Akane,Trial 5,"Well, Monokuma?",8,5,0,50,50,,,
06149,Akane,Trial 5,Are you sticking up for him?,8,5,0,51,51,,,
06150,Akane,Trial 5,"Hey Monokuma, you heard us! The voting is gonna have to wait!",8,5,0,52,52,,,
06151,Akane,Trial 5,"So if we're working together, where do we start? With the cause of death missing from the Monokuma File?",8,5,0,53,53,,,
06152,Akane,Trial 5,"Then let's bring up whatever we can think of, one after the other! That might clear some things up!",8,5,0,54,54,,,
06153,Akane,Trial 5,If it's something that can't be seen...,8,5,0,55,55,,,
06154,Akane,Trial 5,...maybe he choked himself with a sleeper hold...,8,5,0,56,56,,,
06155,Akane,Trial 5,...or liquified his guts with a body blow!,8,5,0,57,57,,,
06156,Akane,Trial 5,Poison?,8,5,0,58,58,,,

06372,Akane,CG,I wanna try eating it!,8,99,0,81,81,,,
06373,Akane,CG,Ha! This sure is fun!,8,99,0,82,82,,,
06374,Akane,CG,You're hogging all the food! No fair!,8,99,0,101,101,,,

06378,Akane,CG,You're not eating? Then I'm gonna eat all this by myself! *nom*,8,99,0,105,105,,,
06379,Akane,CG,"Turn the lights on! I can't eat like this, y'know?",8,99,0,106,106,,,
06380,Akane,CG,Mudadadadadadada!,8,99,0,107,107,,,
06381,Akane,CG,Shut up! All I gotta do is win!,8,99,0,108,108,,,
06382,Akane,CG,Gahhh!,8,99,0,109,109,,,
06383,Akane,CG,H-hey. Sorry to... keep you guys waiting.,8,99,0,110,110,,,
06384,Akane,CG,Wh-what? Is something wrong? I made sure to... wear a swimsuit this time.,8,99,0,111,111,,,
06385,Akane,CG,O-oh! You're talking about these.,8,99,0,112,112,,,
06386,Akane,CG,"Heh, on my way over here I happened to run into... Coach Nekomaru.",8,99,0,113,113,,,
06387,Akane,CG,"And when that happens I gotta fight him, y'know?",8,99,0,114,114,,,
06388,Akane,CG,"Well, it'll heal as long as I rub some spit in it, right?",8,99,0,115,115,,,
06389,Akane,CG,"Hehe, I'm all fired up now! I never knew such a strong opponent even existed!",8,99,0,116,116,,,
06390,Akane,CG,"Heyyy, your balance sucks! Make sure your stance is wider.",8,99,0,117,117,,,
06391,Akane,CG,"Yeah, cause I'm so buff. Like, every time I get a massage they tell me I'm just a mass of muscles.",8,99,0,118,118,,,
06392,Akane,CG,"Nah, I don't have a trainer. My stepmom's lovers like to get drunk and give me full body massages.",8,99,0,119,119,,,
06393,Akane,CG,"Let's see... Hmm... I see, I see. So that's what happened!",8,99,0,120,120,,,
06394,Akane,CG,"Well, since there's this iron bar I was pretty sure no one would be able to get through the window.",8,99,0,121,121,,,
06395,Akane,CG,But check it out!,8,99,0,122,122,,,
06396,Akane,CG,This iron bar ain't even pinned down. Looks like you can open and close it pretty easy.,8,99,0,123,123,,,
06397,Akane,CG,"See? My head can fit through, no problem.",8,99,0,124,124,,,
06398,Akane,CG,"Yep, yep!",8,99,0,125,125,,,
06399,Akane,CG,D-dammit!,8,99,0,126,126,,,
06400,Akane,CG,Wh-why can't I even graze you with my attacks?,8,99,0,127,127,,,
06401,Akane,CG,Ah! Ah!,8,99,0,128,128,,,
06402,Akane,CG,N-Nekomaru!,8,99,0,129,129,,,
06403,Akane,CG,N-Nekomaru! Why did you s-save-?,8,99,0,130,130,,,
06404,Akane,CG,G-get a hold of yourself! Nekomaru!,8,99,0,131,131,,,
06405,Akane,CG,Gh-!,8,99,0,132,132,,,
06406,Akane,CG,N-Nekomaruuu!,8,99,0,133,133,,,
06407,Akane,CG,Umm... Who are you?,8,99,0,134,134,,,
06408,Akane,CG,N-Nekomaru? Is that you?,8,99,0,135,135,,,
06409,Akane,CG,Yahooo!,8,99,0,136,136,,,
06410,Akane,CG,Why?,8,99,0,137,137,,,
06411,Akane,CG,Why is Nekomaru... Why did he have to die again?,8,99,0,138,138,,,
06412,Akane,CG,Dammit! I never paid you back.,8,99,0,139,139,,,
06413,Akane,CG,I never paid you back for your help last time!,8,99,0,140,140,,,
06414,Akane,CG,Gahahaaa!,8,99,0,141,141,,,
06415,Akane,CG,Hnggg!,8,99,0,142,142,,,
06416,Akane,CG,Hnggg! Hnggggg!,8,99,0,143,143,,,
06417,Akane,CG,"*pant* It's no use, it's barely budging!",8,99,0,144,144,,,
06418,Akane,CG,"Alright, if that's how it's gonna be...",8,99,0,145,145,,,
06419,Akane,CG,...my body can take it! Power times three!,8,99,0,146,146,,,
06420,Akane,CG,"Alright, I got him!",8,99,0,147,147,,,
06421,Akane,CG,A-are you crazy or somethin'?,8,99,0,148,148,,,
06422,Akane,CG,"Playtime's over. Now, where'd you hide the bombs?",8,99,0,149,149,,,
06423,Akane,CG,Ha? Torture?,8,99,0,150,150,,,
06424,Akane,CG,That's fine with me! Just die already!,8,99,0,151,151,,,
06425,Akane,CG,"Hey, do you guys hear something?",8,99,0,152,152,,,
06426,Akane,CG,"No, I'm not talking about the music.",8,99,0,153,153,,,
06427,Akane,CG,"Hey, is it just me or does it feel like the fire's not going out at all!",8,99,0,154,154,,,
06428,Akane,CG,Wh-what are we gonna do? All we can do now is pray for rain!,8,99,0,155,155,,,
06429,Akane,CG,Hmm? Everyone?,8,99,0,156,156,,,
06430,Peko,Trial 1,"No, that's not possible.",15,1,0,1,1,,,
06431,Peko,Trial 1,Of course. I have proof to back me up.,15,1,0,2,2,,,
06432,Peko,Trial 1,I'm sure Byakuya ducked under the table...,15,1,0,3,3,,,
06433,Peko,Trial 1,...during the blackout.,15,1,0,4,4,,,
06434,Peko,Trial 1,Byakuya couldn't see in the dark either.,15,1,0,5,5,,,
06435,Peko,Trial 1,I doubt he could've seen the killer.,15,1,0,6,6,,,
06436,Peko,Trial 1,Why do you say that?,15,1,0,7,7,,,
06437,Peko,Trial 1,So... Are you saying Byakuya was the one who used those night vision goggles?,15,1,0,8,8,,,
06438,Peko,Trial 1,This may be off-topic but why was Byakuya acting so paranoid?,15,1,0,9,9,,,
06439,Peko,Trial 1,"Not only did he bring a self defense kit but he had night vision goggles inside the case, too.",15,1,0,10,10,,,
06440,Peko,Trial 1,"It doesn't matter who wrote it yet. So, Byakuya became paranoid because of this threatening letter?",15,1,0,11,11,,,
06441,Peko,Trial 1,I see... Strong sense of responsibility as our leader was his undoing.,15,1,0,12,12,,,
06442,Peko,Trial 1,I am not the killer.,15,1,0,13,13,,,
06443,Peko,Trial 1,That's impossible!,15,1,0,14,14,,,
06444,Peko,Trial 1,Because I was not in the office...,15,1,0,15,15,,,
06445,Peko,Trial 1,...not even before the blackout.,15,1,0,16,16,,,
06446,Peko,Trial 1,Sorry.,15,1,0,17,17,,,
06447,Peko,Trial 1,I... I guess that would be... true.,15,1,0,18,18,,,
06448,Peko,Trial 1,I-it's fine. How about we stop talking about this and move on to something else?,15,1,0,19,19,,,
06449,Peko,Trial 1,I-I said it's fine!,15,1,0,20,20,,,
06450,Peko,Trial 1,"As soon as I stepped into the office, I felt this sudden rush of pain in my stomach...",15,1,0,21,21,,,
06451,Peko,Trial 1,"Because of that I was unable to leave the bathroom, including when the blackout occurred.",15,1,0,22,22,,,
06452,Peko,Trial 1,I don't remember eating anything weird...,15,1,0,23,23,,,
06453,Peko,Trial 1,...just a little bit from the dining hall.,15,1,0,24,24,,,
06454,Peko,Trial 1,I apologize for causing a scene.,15,1,0,25,25,,,
06455,Peko,Trial 1,"I couldn't have prevented the blackout even if I was in the office but even so, I feel regret.",15,1,0,26,26,,,
06456,Peko,Trial 1,"If I was in the office, I could've reset the breaker in time and maybe the murder wouldn't have occurred.",15,1,0,27,27,,,
06457,Peko,Trial 1,"That reminds me, Nagito was the one who suggested I guard the office.",15,1,0,28,28,,,
06458,Peko,Trial 1,The threatening letter along with all your suggestions... It was all a trap to manipulate us.,15,1,0,29,29,,,
06459,Peko,Trial 1,He has already confessed!,15,1,0,30,30,,,
06460,Peko,Trial 1,"However, after hearing what Byakuya and Nagito said in the dark...",15,1,0,31,31,,,
06461,Peko,Trial 1,...it almost sounds like Byakuya fought back against Nagito or something.,15,1,0,32,32,,,
06462,Peko,Trial 1,If he stabbed Byakuya to death it's strange he didn't get splattered with an appropriate amount of blood.,15,1,0,33,33,,,
06463,Peko,Trial 1,So... Gundham knows how to get under the floorboards.,15,1,0,34,34,,,
06464,Peko,Trial 1,"Anyway, sounds like you can go under the floorboards from the storage room.",15,1,0,35,35,,,
06465,Peko,Trial 1,I believe there's no need to discuss this matter further but... I was unable to leave the bathroom.,15,1,0,36,36,,,
06466,Peko,Trial 1,"Nagito, what are you plotting? For someone who insists he's not the killer, you are quite nosy.",15,1,0,37,37,,,
06467,Peko,Trial 1,She heard... Teruteru's voice in the dining hall?,15,1,0,38,38,,,
06468,Peko,Trial 1,I see... So he brazenly shouted from under the floor to make us think he was in the dining hall.,15,1,0,39,39,,,
06469,Peko,Trial 1,"Which means, he obviously hid it somewhere in the old building.",15,1,0,40,40,,,
06470,Peko,Trial 1,It seems this is the end.,15,1,0,41,41,,,
06471,Peko,Trial 2,Some of us have not beaten that game. Give us a detailed explanation.,15,2,0,1,1,,,
06472,Peko,Trial 2,"So the mystery of the game is the murder of Girl E, correct?",15,2,0,2,2,,,
06473,Peko,Trial 2,So how did Girl E get from outside the school...,15,2,0,3,3,,,
06474,Peko,Trial 2,...to the front of the music room?,15,2,0,4,4,,,
06475,Peko,Trial 2,"So, when the four of them ran over after they heard the sound, Girl E acted like she had just rushed over too.",15,2,0,5,5,,,
06476,Peko,Trial 2,But does Mahiru's murder does anything to do with that game? Perhaps the two are unrelated.,15,2,0,6,6,,,
06477,Peko,Trial 2,"If you keep making up your mind like that, we're just going to go around in circles.",15,2,0,7,7,,,
06478,Peko,Trial 2,"And, it's true Fuyuhiko may look suspicious but don't you think that'd be too obvious?",15,2,0,8,8,,,
06479,Peko,Trial 2,"I mean, there's a possibility that it's a trap set by the true killer.",15,2,0,9,9,,,
06480,Peko,Trial 2,The true killer played that game and most likely found out about the relationships between the characters.,15,2,0,10,10,,,
06481,Peko,Trial 2,That person could be using that knowledge to try and set up Fuyuhiko.,15,2,0,11,11,,,
06482,Peko,Trial 2,"Isn't that what happened, Hiyoko?",15,2,0,12,12,,,
06483,Peko,Trial 2,Don't you understand? I'm saying you might be the true killer.,15,2,0,13,13,,,
06484,Peko,Trial 2,Do you know where Hiyoko was today?,15,2,0,14,14,,,
06485,Peko,Trial 2,"She was at the beach house, the scene of the crime!",15,2,0,15,15,,,
06486,Peko,Trial 2,"Plus, the footprints left in the sand were facing away from the beach house.",15,2,0,16,16,,,
06487,Peko,Trial 2,"Which means, when the owner of these footprints went inside the beach house, they used a different entrance.",15,2,0,17,17,,,
06488,Peko,Trial 2,"Which means, something happened inbetween those two events. Isn't that right, Hiyoko?",15,2,0,18,18,,,
06489,Peko,Trial 2,"I see... So if she met Mahiru at 2:30 PM, killed her, then ran away afterward...",15,2,0,19,19,,,
06490,Peko,Trial 2,I think 3:30 PM is a reasonable time for you to have witnessed Hiyoko.,15,2,0,20,20,,,
06491,Peko,Trial 2,Just leave him alone. It'd be a waste of time to question him any further.,15,2,0,21,21,,,
06492,Peko,Trial 2,"Anyway, that letter in Kazuichi's testimony says it all. You were meeting up with Mahiru at the beach house.",15,2,0,22,22,,,
06493,Peko,Trial 2,We can assume she summoned Mahiru with the intention of killing her all along. ,15,2,0,23,23,,,
06494,Peko,Trial 2,"That's why she wrote a letter to let her know where to meet, so the others wouldn't find out.",15,2,0,24,24,,,
06495,Peko,Trial 2,"And then you went ahead to the beach house, hid yourself in a specific place and waited for Mahiru.",15,2,0,25,25,,,
06496,Peko,Trial 2,"There's evidence for that, too.",15,2,0,26,26,,,
06497,Peko,Trial 2,"Yes, that's right. The gummy candy we found on the floor is the evidence.",15,2,0,27,27,,,
06498,Peko,Trial 2,"Hiyoko, your favorite candy is gummies, correct?",15,2,0,28,28,,,
06499,Peko,Trial 2,But Hiyoko miscalculated that Mahiru's body would be blocking the door at that time.,15,2,0,29,29,,,
06500,Peko,Trial 2,"Because of that, she was only able to leave from the beach side door and ended up leaving her footprints.",15,2,0,30,30,,,
06501,Peko,Trial 2,Wha-?,15,2,0,31,31,,,
06502,Peko,Trial 2,What's most important is what happened afterwards. What on Earth happened there?,15,2,0,32,32,,,
06503,Peko,Trial 2,Do you mean the letter?,15,2,0,33,33,,,
06504,Peko,Trial 2,But could two people even hide in such a small place? And without Hiyoko knowing?,15,2,0,34,34,,,
06505,Peko,Trial 2,"In theory, but... that's impossible.",15,2,0,35,35,,,
06506,Peko,Trial 2,Try to remember the refridgerator carefully and then you will understand...,15,2,0,36,36,,,
06507,Peko,Trial 2,...that there's no possible way the drinks in the refridgerator were used.,15,2,0,37,37,,,
06508,Peko,Trial 2,It's true there were drinks...,15,2,0,38,38,,,
06509,Peko,Trial 2,...in the beach house refridgerator.,15,2,0,39,39,,,
06510,Peko,Trial 2,"However, try thinking about it.",15,2,0,40,40,,,
06511,Peko,Trial 2,One bottled drink is simply not enough.,15,2,0,41,41,,,
06512,Peko,Trial 2,It wouldn't be enough to wash off the blood.,15,2,0,42,42,,,
06513,Peko,Trial 2,"Heh, didn't I say it was impossible?",15,2,0,43,43,,,
06514,Peko,Trial 2,There were no water bottles in the refridgerator.,15,2,0,44,44,,,
06515,Peko,Trial 2,There were only flavored drinks with colored dyes.,15,2,0,45,45,,,
06516,Peko,Trial 2,If you use those to wash blood off...,15,2,0,46,46,,,
06517,Peko,Trial 2,...the blood won't come off and your body will get sticky.,15,2,0,47,47,,,
06518,Peko,Trial 2,"It will leave an aromatic smell, too.",15,2,0,48,48,,,
06519,Peko,Trial 2,Especially if you used a lot.,15,2,0,49,49,,,
06520,Peko,Trial 2,That alone would raise suspicion.,15,2,0,50,50,,,
06521,Peko,Trial 2,H-how many times do I have to tell you? There were no water bottles in there whatsoever.,15,2,0,51,51,,,
06522,Peko,Trial 2,So you're saying the water bottles were gone because they were all used? That's a logical fallacy.,15,2,0,52,52,,,
06523,Peko,Trial 2,...,15,2,0,53,53,,,
06524,Peko,Trial 2,Then I should ask you this. Why do you believe I'm the killer?,15,2,0,54,54,,,
06525,Peko,Trial 2,...,15,2,0,55,55,,,
06526,Peko,Trial 2,Do you really? This mystery seems unsolveable.,15,2,0,56,56,,,
06527,Peko,Trial 2,I see...,15,2,0,57,57,,,
06528,Peko,Trial 2,Then let's hear this alleged method of escaping the beach house.,15,2,0,58,58,,,
06529,Peko,Trial 2,...,15,2,0,59,59,,,
06530,Peko,Trial 2,...,15,2,0,60,60,,,
06531,Peko,Trial 2,...,15,2,0,61,61,,,
06532,Peko,Trial 2,It's fine.,15,2,0,62,62,,,
06533,Peko,Trial 2,I said it's fine! Saying anything more would just be an exercise in futility.,15,2,0,63,63,,,
06534,Peko,Trial 2,Agreed. Hurry up and vote.,15,2,0,64,64,,,
06535,Peko,Trial 2,Can it wait until after the voting?,15,2,0,65,65,,,
06536,Peko,Trial 2,My motive?,15,2,0,66,66,,,
06537,Peko,Trial 2,"Hmm, so it's about that. Let's see... If I must answer that question...",15,2,0,67,67,,,
06538,Peko,Trial 2,...I must say it was for the sake of justice.,15,2,0,68,68,,,
06539,Peko,Trial 2,In order to... protect the justice of this world.,15,2,0,69,69,,,
06540,Peko,Trial 2,I do not sully my hands to satisfy personal grudges.,15,2,0,70,70,,,
06541,Peko,Trial 2,There is only one reason I kill.,15,2,0,71,71,,,
06542,Peko,Trial 2,For the sake of protecting justice!,15,2,0,72,72,,,
06543,Peko,Trial 2,"Justice is what mankes humans human, it's a virtue that human beings should be proud of!",15,2,0,73,73,,,
06544,Peko,Trial 2,"Justice is the eternal sun and the enduring moon, the protective father and the smiling mother.",15,2,0,74,74,,,
06545,Peko,Trial 2,If justice ever disappeared from this world...,15,2,0,75,75,,,
06546,Peko,Trial 2,...the world would immediately freeze and people's smiles would vanish.,15,2,0,76,76,,,
06547,Peko,Trial 2,I will not allow that!,15,2,0,77,77,,,
06548,Peko,Trial 2,"Justice must always be there to guide us, to shine bright above our heads.",15,2,0,78,78,,,
06549,Peko,Trial 2,So I must fight! I must continue to fight to protect justice!,15,2,0,79,79,,,
06550,Peko,Trial 2,"As the light of justice shines upon my mask, I expose the hearts of malevolent evil!",15,2,0,80,80,,,
06551,Peko,Trial 2,Justice complete!,15,2,0,81,81,,,
06552,Peko,Trial 2,The center of justice that is pierced by justice! The lead star of justice that shines in the night sky!,15,2,0,82,82,,,
06553,Peko,Trial 2, That would be me... Sparkling Justice! (??),15,2,0,83,83,,,
06554,Peko,Trial 2,Now then...let's execute justice!(??),15,2,0,84,84,,,
06555,Peko,Trial 2,I am Sparkling Justice...,15,2,0,85,85,,,
06556,Peko,Trial 2,"In the name of sparkling, shining justice, I have come to deliver justice! (????)",15,2,0,86,86,,,
06557,Peko,Trial 2,This mask is the dividing line.,15,2,0,87,87,,,
06558,Peko,Trial 2,Just like various idols... The sun is revered because it lies just beyond your grasp...,15,2,0,88,88,,,
06559,Peko,Trial 2,"Justice should also be the same! (*??*)?""??",15,2,0,89,89,,,

06779,Hiyoko,Trial 2,Girl E and Mahiru were killed by that guy!,11,2,0,9,9,,,

06847,Hiyoko,Trial 2,She asked if we could meet up later.,11,2,0,77,77,,,
06848,Hiyoko,Trial 2,C-cuz I thought I'd be doubted if I admitted it. So I thought it'd be better not to say anything.,11,2,0,78,78,,,
06849,Hiyoko,Trial 2,"I told her it was fine. I mean, I didn't have a reason to say no...",11,2,0,79,79,,,

06867,Hiyoko,Trial 2,The killer returned to the scene of the crime? After I left?,11,2,0,97,97,,,
06868,Hiyoko,Trial 2,That's impossible! There's nowhere to hide!,11,2,0,98,98,,,
06869,Hiyoko,Trial 2,I even glanced inside the shower room as I was running away but there was nobody there!,11,2,0,99,99,,,
06870,Hiyoko,Trial 2,You spent all that time thinking just to say something so pointless? How disappointing!,11,2,0,100,100,,,

06971,Sonia,Trial 1,That sounds correct!,10,1,0,1,1,,,
06972,Sonia,Trial 1,So... He tried to do something about it without telling anyone?,10,1,0,2,2,,,
06973,Sonia,Trial 1,"Umm, pardon me. Can I say something, please?",10,1,0,3,3,,,
06974,Sonia,Trial 1,I regret that I must return to this topic but... I just realized something concerning the night vision goggles.,10,1,0,4,4,,,

06977,Sonia,Trial 1,"...you brought food to the office, right?",10,1,0,7,7,,,
06978,Sonia,Trial 1,Cease this bickering!,10,1,0,8,8,,,
06979,Sonia,Trial 1,It does not have to be the breaker...,10,1,0,9,9,,,

06981,Sonia,Trial 1,Indubitably?,10,1,0,11,11,,,
06982,Sonia,Trial 1,"If so, even if Peko was in the office, it still would've been possible to cause a blackout. Indubitably!",10,1,0,12,12,,,
06983,Sonia,Trial 1,Huh? Even though we have been arguing for so long?,10,1,0,13,13,,,
06984,Sonia,Trial 1,He seems like the sort of person while watchin Friday the 13th. Just like me!,10,1,0,14,14,,,

06986,Sonia,Trial 1,Is there something wrong with that?,10,1,0,16,16,,,
06987,Sonia,Trial 1,Then someone definitely went under the floorboards through the storage room during the party.,10,1,0,17,17,,,
06988,Sonia,Trial 1,P-pass the torch?,10,1,0,18,18,,,

06990,Sonia,Trial 1,That would be the moment someone grabbed ahold of the knife!,10,1,0,20,20,,,

06992,Sonia,Trial 1,Is that... an iron skewer?,10,1,0,22,22,,,
06993,Sonia,Trial 2,"But... Girl D was the one who went to the office to get the key to the music room, right?",10,2,0,1,1,,,
06994,Sonia,Trial 2,Then she attacked her with the fish tank!,10,2,0,2,2,,,
06995,Sonia,Trial 2,Are you saying that a completely different killer murdered Mahiru and used the game motive as their cover?,10,2,0,3,3,,,
06996,Sonia,Trial 2,"That is right, it cannot be Hiyoko. That mask belongs to Sparkling Justice!",10,2,0,4,4,,,
06997,Sonia,Trial 2,That mask says it all. Sparkling Justice is hiding on this island!,10,2,0,5,5,,,

07017,Sonia,Trial 2,The article was written in their native language so I tried to translate it.,10,2,0,25,25,,,
07018,Sonia,Trial 2,Yes. The magazine I read was written in Spanish.,10,2,0,26,26,,,
07019,Sonia,Trial 2,"So, Sparkling Justice's catchphrase was no doubt written in Spanish as well.",10,2,0,27,27,,,

07027,Sonia,Trial 3,P-please stop making bad jokes!,10,3,0,7,7,,,
07028,Sonia,Trial 3,How did they lock the door?,10,3,0,8,8,,,
07029,Sonia,Trial 3,That door should not have had a lock!,10,3,0,9,9,,,
07030,Sonia,Trial 3,I have seen this in serial crime dramas!,10,3,0,10,10,,,
07031,Sonia,Trial 3,I believe it is not something one typically eats.,10,3,0,11,11,,,
07032,Sonia,Trial 3,I see... So the scrap that was caught on the baton lighting was originally part of the wallpaper.,10,3,0,12,12,,,
07033,Sonia,Trial 3,So they used the baton lighting on the ceiling to hang the wallpaper?,10,3,0,13,13,,,
07034,Sonia,Trial 3,If her feet were on the floor...,10,3,0,14,14,,,

07038,Sonia,Trial 3,"Aside from Mikan, none of us were aware of that fact. So the killer probably did not know it either.",10,3,0,18,18,,,

07040,Sonia,Trial 3,"Umm, Nagito? What do you mean, if the victim actually committed suicide?",10,3,0,20,20,,,
07041,Sonia,Trial 3,F-forced? Perhaps... they used hypnotism or something?,10,3,0,21,21,,,
07042,Sonia,Trial 3,So... an alibi...,10,3,0,22,22,,,
07043,Sonia,Trial 3,Then our plan is to destroy the weakest alibi!,10,3,0,23,23,,,
07044,Sonia,Trial 3,"Since Hajime has seen the video, it is clear what time the crime took place.",10,3,0,24,24,,,

07049,Sonia,Trial 3,Y-you two have alibis?,10,3,0,29,29,,,
07050,Sonia,Trial 3,"Hmm... It feels like operation ""Destroy the weakest alibi"" has backed us into a corner instead...",10,3,0,30,30,,,
07051,Sonia,Trial 3,"No, maybe...",10,3,0,31,31,,,
07052,Sonia,Trial 3,...she went out of her own free will!,10,3,0,32,32,,,
07053,Sonia,Trial 3,"So, exactly as I assumed...",10,3,0,33,33,,,
07054,Sonia,Trial 3,Hiyoko seemed to be really struggling with wearing her kimono.,10,3,0,34,34,,,
07055,Sonia,Trial 3,I believe that was one of the reasons she locked herself in her room.,10,3,0,35,35,,,
07056,Sonia,Trial 3,That is why I informed her.,10,3,0,36,36,,,
07057,Sonia,Trial 3,I told her that there was a full-length mirror at the music venue and I suggested that she used it.,10,3,0,37,37,,,

07061,Sonia,Trial 3,"He did discover the body, I doubt his attention was focused on the camera.",10,3,0,41,41,,,
07062,Sonia,Trial 3,Or did they make some kind of set?,10,3,0,42,42,,,
07063,Sonia,Trial 3,That curtain was hung so the music venue would look like the conference room?,10,3,0,43,43,,,
07064,Sonia,Trial 3,The motel would've been so far. And the interior design of the movie theater is too distinctive.,10,3,0,44,44,,,
07065,Sonia,Trial 3,"The incident isn't happening at the scene of the crime, it's occurring in the conference room!",10,3,0,45,45,,,
07066,Sonia,Trial 3,But why did the killer go to the trouble of making a fake video just so Hajime could go to the crime scene?,10,3,0,46,46,,,
07067,Sonia,Trial 3,Huh?,10,3,0,47,47,,,
07068,Sonia,Trial 3,An alibi? Was that the killer's goal?,10,3,0,48,48,,,
07069,Sonia,Trial 3,"J-just like Akane said, it is really hard to tie it all together. I mean, Mikan is the killer?",10,3,0,49,49,,,
07070,Sonia,Trial 3,"That ""slow-witted"" remark is not necessary.",10,3,0,50,50,,,
07071,Sonia,Trial 3,"Scars? You mean the rope burn, right?",10,3,0,51,51,,,
07072,Sonia,Trial 3,Y-you are right. And you have been a great help to us so far.,10,3,0,52,52,,,
07073,Sonia,Trial 3,"Umm, forgiveness or not, we still have not decided if Mikan is the killer. ",10,3,0,53,53,,,
07074,Sonia,Trial 3,"M-Mikan, you... What has happened to you?",10,3,0,54,54,,,
07075,Sonia,Trial 4,"Ah, Akane! You seem to be having an impressive amount of drool flowing from your mouth.",10,4,0,1,1,,,
07076,Sonia,Trial 4,"Umm, I discovered Nekomaru's body a little after 7 AM.",10,4,0,2,2,,,
07077,Sonia,Trial 4,I headed over to Grape Tower for Monokuma Tai Chi and found the body there.,10,4,0,3,3,,,
07078,Sonia,Trial 4,Hajime and Chiaki were also with me.,10,4,0,4,4,,,
07079,Sonia,Trial 4,"Imbecile, I am not some woman with flexible legs!",10,4,0,5,5,,,
07080,Sonia,Trial 4,"And then, the three of us discovered Nekomaru's body.",10,4,0,6,6,,,
07081,Sonia,Trial 4,"The incident notwithstanding, I also have many questions.",10,4,0,7,7,,,
07082,Sonia,Trial 4,If it was unexpected I suppose that is possible...,10,4,0,8,8,,,
07083,Sonia,Trial 4,Then what was the real weapon used to murder Nekomaru?,10,4,0,9,9,,,
07084,Sonia,Trial 4,"Umm, there may be a way to use the pillar as a weapon without lifting it.",10,4,0,10,10,,,
07085,Sonia,Trial 4,Yes. For reals.,10,4,0,11,11,,,
07086,Sonia,Trial 4,"Understood, then I shall give it my all!",10,4,0,12,12,,,
07087,Sonia,Trial 4,"Sonia, here I go!",10,4,0,13,13,,,
07088,Sonia,Trial 4,There's no need to lift that pillar.,10,4,0,14,14,,,
07089,Sonia,Trial 4,What about tipping the pillar over?,10,4,0,15,15,,,
07090,Sonia,Trial 4,They aimed right for his head and bullseye!,10,4,0,16,16,,,
07091,Sonia,Trial 4,Huh? Fragments?,10,4,0,17,17,,,
07092,Sonia,Trial 4,I... I see. That was entirely... my bad.,10,4,0,18,18,,,
07093,Sonia,Trial 4,I-is that true?,10,4,0,19,19,,,
07094,Sonia,Trial 4,So... Nagito knows what the Ultimate Weapon is?,10,4,0,20,20,,,
07095,Sonia,Trial 4,"No, you are far great than the Ultimate Weapon since you wield your Four Dark Devas of Destruction.",10,4,0,21,21,,,
07096,Sonia,Trial 4,"Anyway, we must first clarify this secret of the Funhouse, right? ",10,4,0,22,22,,,
07097,Sonia,Trial 4,Then I think it must have something to do with the structure of the Funhouse.,10,4,0,23,23,,,
07098,Sonia,Trial 4,Strawberry House leads to Strawberry Tower and Grape House leads to Grape Tower.,10,4,0,24,24,,,
07099,Sonia,Trial 4,"But in actuality, they are both the same building and both houses are linked to the central tower.",10,4,0,25,25,,,
07100,Sonia,Trial 4,"It is undeniable that such a ""sweet"" building structure is the secret of the Funhouse!",10,4,0,26,26,,,
07101,Sonia,Trial 4,Fo' sho! I shall leave this matter to your discretion!,10,4,0,27,27,,,
07102,Sonia,Trial 4,"In truth, Strawberry Tower and Grape Tower...",10,4,0,28,28,,,
07103,Sonia,Trial 4,...are actually the exact same place!,10,4,0,29,29,,,
07104,Sonia,Trial 4,Wh-why are you asking that now? Do you harbor a grudge because my kingdom destroyed your homeland?,10,4,0,30,30,,,
07105,Sonia,Trial 4,Then how about this: Someboy moved Nekomaru's body.,10,4,0,31,31,,,
07106,Sonia,Trial 4,Then Monokuma did it!,10,4,0,32,32,,,
07107,Sonia,Trial 4,"While we were moving, Monokuma quickly moved things around.",10,4,0,33,33,,,
07108,Sonia,Trial 4,"If it is too heavy to carry, let them roll it.",10,4,0,34,34,,,
07109,Sonia,Trial 4,"Just like if there is no bread, let them eat cake.",10,4,0,35,35,,,
07110,Sonia,Trial 4,There are many different ways...,10,4,0,36,36,,,
07111,Sonia,Trial 4,...the body and the pillar could've been moved.,10,4,0,37,37,,,
07112,Sonia,Trial 4,The pillar could have been rolled...,10,4,0,38,38,,,
07113,Sonia,Trial 4,...and Nekomaru could've been moved piece by piece!,10,4,0,39,39,,,
07114,Sonia,Trial 4,I decree it was Monokuma's doing!,10,4,0,40,40,,,
07115,Sonia,Trial 4,It seems you have forgotten.,10,4,0,41,41,,,
07116,Sonia,Trial 4,Monokuma is surprisingly strong.,10,4,0,42,42,,,
07117,Sonia,Trial 4,Wielding the power of the futuristic robo-bear...,10,4,0,43,43,,,
07118,Sonia,Trial 4,"...the pillar, the body, everything at the crime scene...",10,4,0,44,44,,,
07119,Sonia,Trial 4,"...he could've moved it all, easy as pie!",10,4,0,45,45,,,
07120,Sonia,Trial 4,Huh?,10,4,0,46,46,,,
07121,Sonia,Trial 4,I-I am terribly sorry. I cannot believe I got so fired up!,10,4,0,47,47,,,
07122,Sonia,Trial 4,But... the Monokuma archive should be the only room on the third floor of Grape House.,10,4,0,48,48,,,
07123,Sonia,Trial 4,"Oh, snap! I never expected that the two houses were connected vertically!",10,4,0,49,49,,,
07124,Sonia,Trial 4,"Oh, I see. Do whatever you like.",10,4,0,50,50,,,
07125,Sonia,Trial 4,"You're magnificent, Gundham!",10,4,0,51,51,,,
07126,Sonia,Trial 4,"Unless Kazuichi was the one who built the dummy, then it would be a different story.",10,4,0,52,52,,,
07127,Sonia,Trial 4,"I see, that is disappointing...",10,4,0,53,53,,,
07128,Sonia,Trial 4,P-please hold on! If the inside of the whole tower ascends and descends like an elevator...,10,4,0,54,54,,,
07129,Sonia,Trial 4,...then why is there a picture of a Strawberry on the far back door when you enter from Grape Tower...,10,4,0,55,55,,,
07130,Sonia,Trial 4,...and a picture of a Grape on the far back door when you enter from Strawberry Tower?,10,4,0,56,56,,,
07131,Sonia,Trial 4,"Plus, after the incident the far back door in Grape Tower had chains wrapped around it, right?",10,4,0,57,57,,,
07132,Sonia,Trial 4,"But when we entered Strawberry Tower, those chains were gone.",10,4,0,58,58,,,
07133,Sonia,Trial 4,"Just fo' sho, why was something like that necessary?",10,4,0,59,59,,,
07134,Sonia,Trial 4,Would it really have inconvenienced the killer if we learned the true structure of the building?,10,4,0,60,60,,,
07135,Sonia,Trial 4,"Gundham, please proceed.",10,4,0,61,61,,,
07136,Sonia,Trial 4,What does this mean?,10,4,0,62,62,,,
07137,Sonia,Trial 4,The elevator should move...,10,4,0,63,63,,,
07138,Sonia,Trial 4,"However, at both houses...",10,4,0,64,64,,,
07139,Sonia,Trial 4,If the contact elevator is behind you...,10,4,0,65,65,,,
07140,Sonia,Trial 4,...the towers are in opposite directions!,10,4,0,66,66,,,
07141,Sonia,Trial 4,It's clearly contradictory!,10,4,0,67,67,,,
07142,Sonia,Trial 4,Rotated 180 degrees?,10,4,0,68,68,,,
07143,Sonia,Trial 4,"The Funhouse itself is the weapon, so they killed using the building structure?",10,4,0,69,69,,,
07144,Sonia,Trial 4,I-is it really alright to accept the situation so easily?,10,4,0,70,70,,,
07145,Sonia,Trial 4,"A-Akane, you are drooling waterfalls?",10,4,0,71,71,,,
07146,Sonia,Trial 4,Could it be... his sleep mode?,10,4,0,72,72,,,
07147,Sonia,Trial 4,"Silence, pest!",10,4,0,73,73,,,
07148,Sonia,Trial 4,The hammer is suspicious.,10,4,0,74,74,,,

07150,Sonia,Trial 4,"I-if they did something like that, he would've been suspended in mid-air!",10,4,0,76,76,,,
07151,Sonia,Trial 4,Huh?,10,4,0,77,77,,,
07152,Sonia,Trial 4,Was that... unexpected for the killer too?,10,4,0,78,78,,,
07153,Sonia,Trial 4,"No, I believe you gave your all.",10,4,0,79,79,,,
07154,Sonia,Trial 4,"At this point, it is quite difficult to find a clue that will lead to the killer.",10,4,0,80,80,,,
07155,Sonia,Trial 4,"N-now that you mention it, so did I!",10,4,0,81,81,,,
07156,Sonia,Trial 4,There was no way I could be late for Monokuma Tai Chi so I left for Grape Tower before 7 AM!,10,4,0,82,82,,,
07157,Sonia,Trial 4,We headed for Grape Tower...,10,4,0,83,83,,,
07158,Sonia,Trial 4,"...before 7 AM, I am certain.",10,4,0,84,84,,,
07159,Sonia,Trial 4,The clock inside Grape House?,10,4,0,85,85,,,
07160,Sonia,Trial 4,"Please believe me, we are not lying!",10,4,0,86,86,,,
07161,Sonia,Trial 4,If only I heard the sound when he fell...,10,4,0,87,87,,,
07162,Sonia,Trial 4,...it would've been a great clue.,10,4,0,88,88,,,
07163,Sonia,Trial 4,Rumbling?,10,4,0,89,89,,,
07164,Sonia,Trial 4,"Oh well, that sound everyone heard... I did not hear it at all.",10,4,0,90,90,,,
07165,Sonia,Trial 4,"I could not sleep at all, I was awake the whole night with hunger pangs.",10,4,0,91,91,,,
07166,Sonia,Trial 4,"Excellent work, Akane!",10,4,0,92,92,,,
07167,Sonia,Trial 4,"Which means, that person does not have an alibi for when Nekomaru fell?",10,4,0,93,93,,,
07168,Sonia,Trial 4,"Please, say something!",10,4,0,94,94,,,
07169,Sonia,Trial 4,"H-however, that is also true for me.",10,4,0,95,95,,,
07170,Sonia,Trial 4,It is obvious that I did not hear the alarm in Strawberry House...,10,4,0,96,96,,,
07171,Sonia,Trial 4,"...but I did not hear the rumbling sound either. Isn't that strange? I mean, everyone else heard it.",10,4,0,97,97,,,
07172,Sonia,Trial 4,The reason we could not hear the rumbling noise...,10,4,0,98,98,,,
07173,Sonia,Trial 4,G-Gundham?,10,4,0,99,99,,,
07174,Sonia,Trial 4,"Gundham, umm, you have some sort of explanation, right?",10,4,0,100,100,,,
07175,Sonia,Trial 4,Just like us...,10,4,0,101,101,,,
07176,Sonia,Trial 4,"G-Gundham? Please, can you at least say something?",10,4,0,102,102,,,
07177,Sonia,Trial 4,P-please hold on! We have yet to hear Gndham's rebuttal!,10,4,0,103,103,,,
07178,Sonia,Trial 4,Gundham!,10,4,0,104,104,,,
07179,Sonia,Trial 4,If the killer cannot return to Strawberry House...,10,4,0,105,105,,,
07180,Sonia,Trial 4,"Admit it? Did you say, you admit it?",10,4,0,106,106,,,
07181,Sonia,Trial 4,I cannot believe it. I just... cannot believe.,10,4,0,107,107,,,
07182,Sonia,Trial 4,You... You killed Nekomaru?,10,4,0,108,108,,,
07183,Sonia,Trial 4,I cannot believe something like that!,10,4,0,109,109,,,
07184,Sonia,Trial 5,P-please stop! I feel bad for Monomi.,10,5,0,1,1,,,
07185,Sonia,Trial 5,The reason Nagito's body was covered with wounds...,10,5,0,2,2,,,
07186,Sonia,Trial 5,Definitely the bomb's hiding place!,10,5,0,3,3,,,
07187,Sonia,Trial 5,"However, if they wanted to seal his mouth they did not need to hurt him with such verocity.",10,5,0,4,4,,,
07188,Sonia,Trial 5,"Then, are you saying the killer was trying to make him suffer?",10,5,0,5,5,,,
07189,Sonia,Trial 5,But who could've done that?,10,5,0,6,6,,,
07190,Sonia,Trial 5,"When the fire occurred, everyone in this room was gathered in front of the warehouse!",10,5,0,7,7,,,
07191,Sonia,Trial 5,"Which means, it is plausible to think that nobody here set the fire.",10,5,0,8,8,,,
07192,Sonia,Trial 5,Based on the pattern up until now...,10,5,0,9,9,,,
07193,Sonia,Trial 5,...we should suspect that some kind of setup was used for this.,10,5,0,10,10,,,
07194,Sonia,Trial 5,"I... I do not know that, but... that has been the pattern before.",10,5,0,11,11,,,
07195,Sonia,Trial 5,Damn right it is!,10,5,0,12,12,,,
07196,Sonia,Trial 5,The direct cause of the fire was...,10,5,0,13,13,,,
07197,Sonia,Trial 5,"...the oil lighter found at the crime scene, right?",10,5,0,14,14,,,
07198,Sonia,Trial 5,Based on the shape of that oil lighter...,10,5,0,15,15,,,
07199,Sonia,Trial 5,...it can stand upright while the flame is lit!,10,5,0,16,16,,,
07200,Sonia,Trial 5,"Or perhaps, opening the door caused...",10,5,0,17,17,,,
07201,Sonia,Trial 5,...intense wind pressure to tip over the lighter!,10,5,0,18,18,,,
07202,Sonia,Trial 5,"Just as I thought, it was the wind pressure! A dust devil blown here from the glorious Japan!",10,5,0,19,19,,,
07203,Sonia,Trial 5,"And when we opened the door, the domino effect started and the falling panels eventually reached the lighter.",10,5,0,20,20,,,
07204,Sonia,Trial 5,"B-based on the patterns up until now, I believe some kind of setup was used.",10,5,0,21,21,,,
07205,Sonia,Trial 5,"Umm, Hajime? What do you mean?",10,5,0,22,22,,,
07206,Sonia,Trial 5,Tying just the legs is one thing but...,10,5,0,23,23,,,
07207,Sonia,Trial 5,...tying both arms would be impossible.,10,5,0,24,24,,,
07208,Sonia,Trial 5,"Akane, you should not give it away for free! Make sure they pay you first!",10,5,0,25,25,,,
07209,Sonia,Trial 5,If he threw the knife into the air...,10,5,0,26,26,,,
07210,Sonia,Trial 5,...and let the knife fall...,10,5,0,27,27,,,
07211,Sonia,Trial 5,...could he stab his hand that way?,10,5,0,28,28,,,
07212,Sonia,Trial 5,If he just propped the knife...,10,5,0,29,29,,,
07213,Sonia,Trial 5,...he could've used his bound left hand!,10,5,0,30,30,,,
07214,Sonia,Trial 5,"So what do you think now, Fuyuhiko?",10,5,0,31,31,,,
07215,Sonia,Trial 5,Th-there is a limit to his constitution!,10,5,0,32,32,,,
07216,Sonia,Trial 5,"If you got penetrated by something so big and thick, you would die instantly!",10,5,0,33,33,,,
07217,Sonia,Trial 5,"Like I said, if you got penetrated by something so big and thic, you would die instantly!",10,5,0,34,34,,,
07218,Sonia,Trial 5,I... also agree with that.,10,5,0,35,35,,,
07219,Sonia,Trial 5,"To think that one of us could kill someone with such cruelty, I could never believe that.",10,5,0,36,36,,,
07220,Sonia,Trial 5,"Then are you saying there is a killer among us, Kazuichi?",10,5,0,37,37,,,
07221,Sonia,Trial 5,"Everyone, working together.",10,5,0,38,38,,,
07222,Sonia,Trial 5,When the spear stabbed Nagito...,10,5,0,39,39,,,
07223,Sonia,Trial 5,"...his right hand was covered by the knife, right?",10,5,0,40,40,,,
07224,Sonia,Trial 5,Wh-what are you saying?,10,5,0,41,41,,,
07225,Sonia,Trial 5,P-perish the thought! He was obviously grabbing the spear!,10,5,0,42,42,,,
07226,Sonia,Trial 5,"That is where the clue to solve this mystery resides, right Chiaki?",10,5,0,43,43,,,
07227,Sonia,Trial 5,"I am sorry, of course this mystery will not be solved that easily.",10,5,0,44,44,,,
07228,Sonia,Trial 5,It seems we are stuck. Shall we have tea time?,10,5,0,45,45,,,
07229,Sonia,Trial 5,One step at a time... What does that mean?,10,5,0,46,46,,,
07230,Sonia,Trial 5,"If Nagito did that all by himself, did he have some sort of ESP?",10,5,0,47,47,,,
07231,Sonia,Trial 5,"Not just that, he did all that while gripping a spear?",10,5,0,48,48,,,
07232,Sonia,Trial 5,That spear should not have stabbed Nagito until the very end.,10,5,0,49,49,,,
07233,Sonia,Trial 5,"Which means Nagito wounded himself while he was gripping that spear, right?",10,5,0,50,50,,,
07234,Sonia,Trial 5,"However, there was one thing I still do not understand. He said he would reveal the traitor, right?",10,5,0,51,51,,,
07235,Sonia,Trial 5,Whatever became of that?,10,5,0,52,52,,,
07236,Sonia,Trial 5,So why did he not just do that in the first place?,10,5,0,53,53,,,
07237,Sonia,Trial 5,"If he had no qualms with killing everyone, he did not have to cause a bomb scare to reveal the traitor.",10,5,0,54,54,,,
07238,Sonia,Trial 5,Did he cause a bomb scare for that reason alone?,10,5,0,55,55,,,
07239,Sonia,Trial 5,"You... are right, I suppose.",10,5,0,56,56,,,
07240,Sonia,Trial 5,You are right. It is not as though we can draw any other conclusion.,10,5,0,57,57,,,
07241,Sonia,Trial 5,Like who the traitor is?,10,5,0,58,58,,,
07242,Sonia,Trial 5,Huh? There is something suspicious in the Monokuma file?,10,5,0,59,59,,,
07243,Sonia,Trial 5,"But... the cause of death is obvious, is it not?",10,5,0,60,60,,,
07244,Sonia,Trial 5,The spear in Nagito's stomach. It is obvious just by looking at it that it is the cause of death.,10,5,0,61,61,,,
07245,Sonia,Trial 5,"Are you saying that applies this time, too?",10,5,0,62,62,,,
07246,Sonia,Trial 5,Bad sense?,10,5,0,63,63,,,
07247,Sonia,Trial 5,Huh?,10,5,0,64,64,,,
07248,Sonia,Trial 5,"You are right. We only get one chance to vote, after all.",10,5,0,65,65,,,
07249,Sonia,Trial 5,"If something other than a spear killed Nagito, all I can think of is the knife stabbed into his right hand, but...",10,5,0,66,66,,,
07250,Sonia,Trial 5,"Exactly, we should cooperate at a time like this!",10,5,0,67,67,,,
07251,Sonia,Trial 5,Let us consider a different fatal wound.,10,5,0,68,68,,,
07252,Sonia,Trial 5,Was the cause of death something that cannot be seen?,10,5,0,69,69,,,
07253,Sonia,Trial 5,It is true that poison is not something we can see but... Why did you bring that up all of a sudden?,10,5,0,70,70,,,
07254,Sonia,Trial 5,I-if poison was the cause of death it would not leave an obvious wound on Nagito's body!,10,5,0,71,71,,,
07255,Sonia,Trial 5,"If it was a slow-acting poison, it is possible he consumed it in advance.",10,5,0,72,72,,,
07256,Sonia,Trial 5,Inhaled?,10,5,0,73,73,,,
07257,Sonia,Trial 5,Of course! Hydrolysis!,10,5,0,74,74,,,
07258,Sonia,Trial 5,The chemical bonds that formed the poison were broken down by the water from the sprinklers!,10,5,0,75,75,,,
07259,Sonia,Trial 5,"Ch-Chiaki, what did you just say?",10,5,0,76,76,,,
07260,Sonia,Trial 5,Th-that is impossible!,10,5,0,77,77,,,
07261,Sonia,Trial 5,"I mean, an accomplice? It is just too-!",10,5,0,78,78,,,
07262,Sonia,Trial 5,"E-even if there really was an accomplice, is there any reason we should take the time to figure out who it is?",10,5,0,79,79,,,
07263,Sonia,Trial 5,"Like Fuyuhiko said earlier, it is possible that someone accidentally removed the poison from the crime scene.",10,5,0,80,80,,,
07264,Sonia,Trial 5,"Which means, did Nagito exchange the contents of a fire grenade?",10,5,0,81,81,,,
07265,Sonia,Trial 5,"When I first discovered those fire grenades, I tried to study them a little but...",10,5,0,82,82,,,
07266,Sonia,Trial 5,...the canister was completely sealed shut by a layer of aluminum underneath the lid.,10,5,0,83,83,,,
07267,Sonia,Trial 5,Th-that is true but... There was no sign he was even at the break room.,10,5,0,84,84,,,
07268,Sonia,Trial 5,Huh?,10,5,0,85,85,,,
07269,Sonia,Trial 5,"N-no, that is not just a piece of trash.",10,5,0,86,86,,,
07270,Sonia,Trial 5,"The seal I saw on that fire grenade matched this, it is the same aluminum.",10,5,0,87,87,,,
07271,Sonia,Trial 5,Y-you're right.,10,5,0,88,88,,,
07272,Sonia,Trial 5,Is this not settled? There is no denying that Nagito's death was a suicide.,10,5,0,89,89,,,
07273,Sonia,Trial 5,I-if that is true then the person who brought the person and spread it was...,10,5,0,90,90,,,
07274,Sonia,Trial 5,"Nagito did not commit murder, instead he manipuplated someone else into killing him?",10,5,0,91,91,,,
07275,Sonia,Trial 5,"It is my fault, because I told you all about the fire grenades...",10,5,0,92,92,,,
07276,Sonia,Trial 5,I-I am so sorry! Please vote me as the killer!,10,5,0,93,93,,,
07277,Sonia,Trial 5,"H-however, Monokuma also does not know who the killer is, right?",10,5,0,94,94,,,
07278,Sonia,Trial 5,P-please stop! I will never become queen!,10,5,0,95,95,,,
07279,Sonia,Trial 5,Is giving up all we can do?,10,5,0,96,96,,,
07280,Sonia,Trial 5,U-umm... Chiaki?,10,5,0,97,97,,,
07281,Sonia,Trial 5,"You mean, he left his plan to luck?",10,5,0,98,98,,,
07282,Sonia,Trial 5,You're absolutely right. It is hard to think the traitor would reveal themselves now.,10,5,0,99,99,,,
07283,Sonia,Trial 5,"Ch-Chiaki is the traitor? That is a lie, right? Surely you must be joking!",10,5,0,100,100,,,
07284,Sonia,Trial 5,W-we were not tricked!,10,5,0,101,101,,,
07285,Sonia,Trial 5,"After all, we have been working together all this time! We have been helping each other all this time.",10,5,0,102,102,,,
07286,Sonia,Trial 5,"Chiaki, being a traitor... Being a member of that horrifying Future Foundation...",10,5,0,103,103,,,
07287,Sonia,Trial 5,That is obviously a lie!,10,5,0,104,104,,,
07288,Sonia,Trial 5,"If you say you are the traitor, please provide an explanation that will help us understand.",10,5,0,105,105,,,
07289,Sonia,Trial 5,"We cannot vote until we are satisfied, that is what you said earlier, Chiaki.",10,5,0,106,106,,,
07290,Sonia,Trial 5,But how would you know who the traitor is from that?,10,5,0,107,107,,,
07291,Sonia,Trial 5,There must be some mistake!,10,5,0,108,108,,,
07292,Sonia,Trial 5,"I mean, if Chiaki is the traitor...",10,5,0,109,109,,,
07293,Sonia,Trial 5,...what was all that time we spent with her?,10,5,0,110,110,,,
07294,Sonia,Trial 5,Was that all a lie too?,10,5,0,111,111,,,
07295,Sonia,Trial 5,Chiaki is... She is being controlled by Monokuma. That is why we should help her.,10,5,0,112,112,,,
07296,Sonia,Trial 5,Sh-she knew?,10,5,0,113,113,,,
07297,Sonia,Trial 5,That is a mistake! That must be a mistake!,10,5,0,114,114,,,
07298,Sonia,Trial 5,Why are you saying such things? Do you really want Chiaki to be the traitor?,10,5,0,115,115,,,
07299,Sonia,Trial 5,I will not believe it! I refuse to believe Chiaki is the traitor!,10,5,0,116,116,,,
07300,Sonia,Trial 5,There is... just no way!,10,5,0,117,117,,,
07301,Sonia,Trial 5,Chiaki is not the traitor!,10,5,0,118,118,,,
07302,Sonia,Trial 5,There is no way Chiaki would've known...,10,5,0,119,119,,,
07303,Sonia,Trial 5,...if that bomb was fake or not!,10,5,0,120,120,,,
07304,Sonia,Trial 5,The only person who knew it was a fake was...,10,5,0,121,121,,,
07305,Sonia,Trial 5,"...me, when I tried to detonate it!",10,5,0,122,122,,,
07306,Sonia,Trial 5,"Enough already, please do not say another word.",10,5,0,123,123,,,
07307,Sonia,Trial 5,I do not want this anymore. I am so very tired... of doubting people.,10,5,0,124,124,,,
07308,Sonia,Trial 5,"A-and, just because she knew the bomb was a fake...",10,5,0,125,125,,,
07309,Sonia,Trial 5,...does not mean we should decide she is the traitor!,10,5,0,126,126,,,
07310,Sonia,Trial 5,Even if she knew the bomb was fake...,10,5,0,127,127,,,
07311,Sonia,Trial 5,...that does not prove Chiaki is the traitor!,10,5,0,128,128,,,
07312,Sonia,Trial 5,If that counts as evidence...,10,5,0,129,129,,,
07313,Sonia,Trial 5,...I should be doubted too!,10,5,0,130,130,,,
07314,Sonia,Trial 5,"After all, I also knew the bomb was fake.",10,5,0,131,131,,,
07315,Sonia,Trial 5,There was someone other than me and Monomi...,10,5,0,132,132,,,
07316,Sonia,Trial 5,...who knew that bomb was fake!,10,5,0,133,133,,,
07317,Sonia,Trial 5,That someone is Monokuma!,10,5,0,134,134,,,
07318,Sonia,Trial 5,"Monokuma said so earlier, correct?",10,5,0,135,135,,,
07319,Sonia,Trial 5,He knows everything about this island.,10,5,0,136,136,,,
07320,Sonia,Trial 5,Monokuma probably told Chiaki...,10,5,0,137,137,,,
07321,Sonia,Trial 5,...that it was fake beforehand!,10,5,0,138,138,,,
07322,Sonia,Trial 5,"If so, you cannot declare that...",10,5,0,139,139,,,
07323,Sonia,Trial 5,...Monomi and Chiaki were working together!,10,5,0,140,140,,,
07324,Sonia,Trial 5,Th-that! Monokuma may have just been lying!,10,5,0,141,141,,,
07325,Sonia,Trial 5,H-Hajime! Are you going to believe Monokuma over Chiaki?,10,5,0,142,142,,,
07326,Sonia,Trial 5,Huh?,10,5,0,143,143,,,
07327,Sonia,Trial 5,Are you telling us to believe in you and sacrifice you? That is just too cruel!,10,5,0,144,144,,,
07328,Sonia,Trial 6,Monokuma's nonsensical abilities...,10,6,0,1,1,,,
07329,Sonia,Trial 6,Please do not compare reality to contact lenses!,10,6,0,2,2,,,
07330,Sonia,Trial 6,So that's why we don't have our memories of our lives at Hope's Peak Academy?,10,6,0,3,3,,,
07331,Sonia,Trial 6,What does that mean?,10,6,0,4,4,,,
07332,Sonia,Trial 6,And you were saying that happened to Hiyoko?,10,6,0,5,5,,,
07333,Sonia,Trial 6,Because we did not know each other before we lost our memories!,10,6,0,6,6,,,
07334,Sonia,Trial 6,Strange? What is?,10,6,0,7,7,,,
07335,Sonia,Trial 6,"Now that you mention it, I did hear about a phenomenon quite similar to that.",10,6,0,8,8,,,
07336,Sonia,Trial 6,"In a distant country, there was a certain experiment carried out on one of their prisoners.",10,6,0,9,9,,,
07337,Sonia,Trial 6,"The prisoner was blindfolded, tied to a bed and had small wounds applied to his toes to drain his blood.",10,6,0,10,10,,,
07338,Sonia,Trial 6,That prisoner was left alone in the experiment room as the sound of dripping blood echoed throughout the room.,10,6,0,11,11,,,
07339,Sonia,Trial 6,"But in fact, his blood was not being drained.",10,6,0,12,12,,,
07340,Sonia,Trial 6,He was just forced to listen to the sound of dripping water but he believed he was bleeding to death.,10,6,0,13,13,,,

07342,Sonia,Trial 6,"Ah, then that must mean-!",10,6,0,15,15,,,
07343,Sonia,Trial 6,S-so... you are saying everyone is still alive?,10,6,0,16,16,,,

07565,Kazuichi,Trial 1,Since Peko was in the office...,4,1,0,13,13,,,
07566,Kazuichi,Trial 1,...she could've caused the blackout at any time!,4,1,0,14,14,,,
07567,Kazuichi,Trial 1,"Hmm, don't tell me you're crushing on Peko...",4,1,0,15,15,,,
07568,Kazuichi,Trial 1,You locked yourself in the commode? You should've said so earlier!,4,1,0,16,16,,,
07569,Kazuichi,Trial 1,Maybe they used a remote control?,4,1,0,17,17,,,
07570,Kazuichi,Trial 1,"Indubitably? Miss Sonia, not you too...",4,1,0,18,18,,,
07571,Kazuichi,Trial 1,"J-just stop it already! Seriously, what the hell happened to you?",4,1,0,19,19,,,
07572,Kazuichi,Trial 1,"Th-that's quite the hobby you have there. But like, now's not really the time to bring it up.",4,1,0,20,20,,,
07573,Kazuichi,Trial 1,"Don't get distracted! Our lives are distracted, y'know?",4,1,0,21,21,,,
07574,Kazuichi,Trial 1,"Seriously, how long is it gonna take for you to understand the damn rules!?",4,1,0,22,22,,,
07575,Kazuichi,Trial 1,"You're right, I couldn't even see the office in that darkness and that room was much closer.",4,1,0,23,23,,,
07576,Kazuichi,Trial 1,Island's sirens? Just for littering?,4,1,0,24,24,,,
07577,Kazuichi,Trial 1,"Alright, Monokuma or Monomi, one of you hurry and bring over that piece of meat!",4,1,0,25,25,,,
07578,Kazuichi,Trial 1,You don't get it?,4,1,0,26,26,,,
07579,Kazuichi,Trial 2,Another person?,4,2,0,1,1,,,
07580,Kazuichi,Trial 2,"Okay, you're starting to act weird again...",4,2,0,2,2,,,
07581,Kazuichi,Trial 2,You guys are definitely friends!,4,2,0,3,3,,,
07582,Kazuichi,Trial 2,It's not cute to see an old guy sulk!,4,2,0,4,4,,,
07583,Kazuichi,Trial 2,How was she able to get past those four...,4,2,0,5,5,,,
07584,Kazuichi,Trial 2,...and wait in front of the music room?,4,2,0,6,6,,,
07585,Kazuichi,Trial 2,What the heck? You're so annoying!,4,2,0,7,7,,,
07586,Kazuichi,Trial 2,"A weapon inside the music room, huh?",4,2,0,8,8,,,
07587,Kazuichi,Trial 2,What about broken glass?,4,2,0,9,9,,,
07588,Kazuichi,Trial 2,You're not chosen at all and gravel is impossible! It's too small to be a weapon!,4,2,0,10,10,,,
07589,Kazuichi,Trial 2,But-but... Guy F is...,4,2,0,11,11,,,
07590,Kazuichi,Trial 2,"Aw snap, I remember now! I totally saw you!",4,2,0,12,12,,,
07591,Kazuichi,Trial 2,Me and Hajime met up at the diner around 3 PM to go to the beach.,4,2,0,13,13,,,
07592,Kazuichi,Trial 2,I saw you about 30 minutes later so it should've been around 3:30 PM.,4,2,0,14,14,,,
07593,Kazuichi,Trial 2,"Now that you mention it, you also passed by the diner Fuyhiko. So you should've seen Hiyoko too, right?",4,2,0,15,15,,,
07594,Kazuichi,Trial 2,"D-don't blame Miss Sonia! It's just a difference between cultures. A culture shock, y'know?",4,2,0,16,16,,,
07595,Kazuichi,Trial 2,You waited for your chance to kill Mahiru...,4,2,0,17,17,,,
07596,Kazuichi,Trial 2,...and afterward you fled from the beach house!,4,2,0,18,18,,,
07597,Kazuichi,Trial 2,"Huh? But when I saw her, she was...",4,2,0,19,19,,,
07598,Kazuichi,Trial 2,...she was clean.,4,2,0,20,20,,,
07599,Kazuichi,Trial 2,"Hey, if you think about it the other way around, does that mean whoever was covered in blood is suspicious?",4,2,0,21,21,,,
07600,Kazuichi,Trial 2,"Cuz if so, I believe Akane was soaked with blood when we all met up to go to the beach!",4,2,0,22,22,,,
07601,Kazuichi,Trial 2,The hell it does!,4,2,0,23,23,,,
07602,Kazuichi,Trial 2,You always have to say something snide...,4,2,0,24,24,,,
07603,Kazuichi,Trial 2,"If you were aware of that from the start, you should've done something about it.",4,2,0,25,25,,,
07604,Kazuichi,Trial 2,"Seriously, which side are you on?",4,2,0,26,26,,,
07605,Kazuichi,Trial 2,"Then, does that mean the killer came back?",4,2,0,27,27,,,
07606,Kazuichi,Trial 2,"Well, now that you mention it...",4,2,0,28,28,,,
07607,Kazuichi,Trial 2,"...when I went to the beach house a few days ago, I feel like I drank one of those plastic water bottles...",4,2,0,29,29,,,
07608,Kazuichi,Trial 2,Don't just stay silent! Say something!,4,2,0,30,30,,,
07609,Kazuichi,Trial 2,No one even saw her swimming.,4,2,0,31,31,,,
07610,Kazuichi,Trial 2,Huh?,4,2,0,32,32,,,
07611,Kazuichi,Trial 2,"M-Miss Sonia, ninjas only exist in Japan.",4,2,0,33,33,,,
07612,Kazuichi,Trial 2,"Aww, you just back off!",4,2,0,34,34,,,
07613,Kazuichi,Trial 2,Wh-wh-wh-wh-wha-!?,4,2,0,35,35,,,
07614,Kazuichi,Trial 2,What the fuuuck?,4,2,0,36,36,,,
07615,Kazuichi,Trial 2,Give me a break! Who's gonna die for you?,4,2,0,37,37,,,
07616,Kazuichi,Trial 2,Continue our discussion? But isn't the voting over?,4,2,0,38,38,,,
07617,Kazuichi,Trial 2,"Hey, Miss Sonia isn't a serial killer enthusiast! She just has a little... passion about them than most.",4,2,0,39,39,,,
07618,Kazuichi,Trial 2,"Tch, even if you do grasp it you're just gonna confuse the heck out of us aren't ya?",4,2,0,40,40,,,
07619,Kazuichi,Trial 3,You're fine. Your head's empty anyway.,4,3,0,1,1,,,
07620,Kazuichi,Trial 3,V-various ways?,4,3,0,2,2,,,
07621,Kazuichi,Trial 3,I don't think I can deny that possibility.,4,3,0,3,3,,,
07622,Kazuichi,Trial 3,"After all, Hajime's the only witness!",4,3,0,4,4,,,
07623,Kazuichi,Trial 3,H-hold on a sec! You're the one who brought this up in the first place!,4,3,0,5,5,,,
07624,Kazuichi,Trial 3,So they killed Hiyoko and then taped her up within 10 minutes? There's no way that's possible!,4,3,0,6,6,,,
07625,Kazuichi,Trial 3,What the hell? Why's it gotta be us?,4,3,0,7,7,,,
07626,Kazuichi,Trial 3,What a wicked way of backing us into a wall! Is this his professional skill?,4,3,0,8,8,,,
07627,Kazuichi,Trial 3,"Apologize to Miss Sonia! And me! However, you're not allowed to slice open your stomach this time!",4,3,0,9,9,,,
07628,Kazuichi,Trial 3,Even quick work has limits.,4,3,0,10,10,,,
07629,Kazuichi,Trial 3,What a jeeerk!,4,3,0,11,11,,,
07630,Kazuichi,Trial 3,"Man, he's being annoying again.",4,3,0,12,12,,,
07631,Kazuichi,Trial 3,"Pah, you're one to talk!",4,3,0,13,13,,,
07632,Kazuichi,Trial 3,Maybe her feet were on the floor.,4,3,0,14,14,,,
07633,Kazuichi,Trial 3,"But she was, like, sitting or something.",4,3,0,15,15,,,
07634,Kazuichi,Trial 3,"So instead, there'd be a mark on her ass!",4,3,0,16,16,,,
07635,Kazuichi,Trial 3,Maybe... the heater was running inside the music venue so it would screw with Mikan's autopsy?,4,3,0,17,17,,,
07636,Kazuichi,Trial 3,Can't you just shut up and back off?,4,3,0,18,18,,,
07637,Kazuichi,Trial 3,That's totally impossible! Then she never would've killed her to begin with!,4,3,0,19,19,,,
07638,Kazuichi,Trial 3,"It's a cheap-ass surveillance camera, you know? There's no way it'd have some kind of sweet recording feature.",4,3,0,20,20,,,
07639,Kazuichi,Trial 3,Right before the morning announcement...,4,3,0,21,21,,,
07640,Kazuichi,Trial 3,...I was totally sleeping in my motel room!,4,3,0,22,22,,,
07641,Kazuichi,Trial 3,What about you guys?,4,3,0,23,23,,,
07642,Kazuichi,Trial 3,"Heeey, what kinda situation is that?",4,3,0,24,24,,,
07643,Kazuichi,Trial 3,Seriously just shut up already! Sjt up forever!,4,3,0,25,25,,,
07644,Kazuichi,Trial 3,Because they didn't kill three people like the movie did? That's only because of Monokuma's rule.,4,3,0,26,26,,,
07645,Kazuichi,Trial 3,I have no freaking clue what you're trying to say!,4,3,0,27,27,,,
07646,Kazuichi,Trial 3,If she was forcibly taken from her room there's no way she would've had time to lock it.,4,3,0,28,28,,,
07647,Kazuichi,Trial 3,"Hajime, now's your chance! Make her admit defeat! Or better yet, make her do a little something-something!",4,3,0,29,29,,,
07648,Kazuichi,Trial 3,"Don't go doubting Miss Sonia, you cretin! I'll put you and your hamsters six feet under!",4,3,0,30,30,,,
07649,Kazuichi,Trial 3,"Huh? What do you mean ""for my sake""?",4,3,0,31,31,,,
07650,Kazuichi,Trial 3,"Damn, you don't know the most important part!",4,3,0,32,32,,,
07651,Kazuichi,Trial 3,"Hey, how long are you gonna stay quiet?",4,3,0,33,33,,,
07652,Kazuichi,Trial 3,A-are you freakin kiddin' me? There's no limit to how useless you can be!,4,3,0,34,34,,,
07653,Kazuichi,Trial 3,"The hospital monitor's supposed to capture footage from the music venue camera, y'know?",4,3,0,35,35,,,
07654,Kazuichi,Trial 3,It's easy to say it was filmed somewhere else but the surveillance cameras connection wasn't that strong.,4,3,0,36,36,,,
07655,Kazuichi,Trial 3,The fact that it was able to connect between the hospital and the music venue was amazing enough!,4,3,0,37,37,,,
07656,Kazuichi,Trial 3,Huh? Conference room?,4,3,0,38,38,,,
07657,Kazuichi,Trial 3,Which place resembled the other?,4,3,0,39,39,,,
07658,Kazuichi,Trial 3,Did the conference room look like the music venue?,4,3,0,40,40,,,
07659,Kazuichi,Trial 3,Or did the music venue look like the conference room?,4,3,0,41,41,,,
07660,Kazuichi,Trial 3,"With candle light, you can't see things in that much detail. Maybe they were going for that effect.",4,3,0,42,42,,,
07661,Kazuichi,Trial 3,"With that cheap-ass camera, it won't capture much in a dark area.",4,3,0,43,43,,,
07662,Kazuichi,Trial 3,"But there's no mistake, that's the only place within the connection range of the surveillance camera!",4,3,0,44,44,,,
07663,Kazuichi,Trial 3,It just shows she can't even do that.,4,3,0,45,45,,,
07664,Kazuichi,Trial 3,"Wh-what do you say, Hajime?",4,3,0,46,46,,,
07665,Kazuichi,Trial 3,Wha-? Are you serious?,4,3,0,47,47,,,
07666,Kazuichi,Trial 3,"More importantly, what was all that about the rope? The killer strangled Ibuki, and then?",4,3,0,48,48,,,
07667,Kazuichi,Trial 3,Huh?,4,3,0,49,49,,,
07668,Kazuichi,Trial 3,Did we fall for someone's lie?,4,3,0,50,50,,,
07669,Kazuichi,Trial 3,Wh-what the heck's wrong with her? She's getting weirder by the minute!,4,3,0,51,51,,,
07670,Kazuichi,Trial 3,Wh-whoa! Now she's laughing?,4,3,0,52,52,,,
07671,Kazuichi,Trial 4,Hajime was... with Miss Sonia and Chiaki that early in the morning?,4,4,0,1,1,,,
07672,Kazuichi,Trial 4,D-don't tell me you three were together since last night!?,4,4,0,2,2,,,
07673,Kazuichi,Trial 4,O-of course you're not! You're much classier than that!,4,4,0,3,3,,,
07674,Kazuichi,Trial 4,So we decided to go to the tower for the time being and headed for Strawberry Hall.,4,4,0,4,4,,,
07675,Kazuichi,Trial 4,But someone even broke Strawberry Hall's door button! We couldn't go anywhere because of that.,4,4,0,5,5,,,
07676,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"What do you mean, ""definitely""?",4,4,0,6,6,,,
07677,Kazuichi,Trial 4,You're the cruelest one here!,4,4,0,7,7,,,
07678,Kazuichi,Trial 4,Then let's start with something even Miss Sonia can understand... the weapon.,4,4,0,8,8,,,
07679,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Well, the weapon is obvious, right?",4,4,0,9,9,,,
07680,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"What the heck you guys, the weapon! You can totally tell just by looking!",4,4,0,10,10,,,
07681,Kazuichi,Trial 4,The weapon was right there at the scene of the crime!,4,4,0,11,11,,,
07682,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"No, the hammer!",4,4,0,12,12,,,
07683,Kazuichi,Trial 4,The killer used that hammer...,4,4,0,13,13,,,
07684,Kazuichi,Trial 4,...and beat the crap outta him!,4,4,0,14,14,,,
07685,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"That's right, it was a surprise beating!",4,4,0,15,15,,,
07686,Kazuichi,Trial 4,The weapon is decided!,4,4,0,16,16,,,
07687,Kazuichi,Trial 4,Why not? Why can't you accept it?,4,4,0,17,17,,,
07688,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Well yeah, but... the killer might've wiped off the oil later.",4,4,0,18,18,,,
07689,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Well, obviously... to make the hammer look like it's not the murder weapon.",4,4,0,19,19,,,
07690,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Just so you all now, I was trying to test you guys.",4,4,0,20,20,,,
07691,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"I thought, maybe you guys mistook the hammer for the weapon or something...",4,4,0,21,21,,,
07692,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Then even if Nekomaru could've lifted that pillar, it has nothing to do with the case at all.",4,4,0,22,22,,,
07693,Kazuichi,Trial 4,What the heck?,4,4,0,23,23,,,
07694,Kazuichi,Trial 4,Even I could probably tip it over!,4,4,0,24,24,,,
07695,Kazuichi,Trial 4,How much longer are you gonna focus on the pillar? Just let it go already!,4,4,0,25,25,,,
07696,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"A feeling, huh? That's just your instincts.",4,4,0,26,26,,,
07697,Kazuichi,Trial 4,Wh-what did you say?,4,4,0,27,27,,,
07698,Kazuichi,Trial 4,Isn't that... the thing you get when you clear the Final Dead Room?,4,4,0,28,28,,,
07699,Kazuichi,Trial 4,I dunno why but I'm not liking this.,4,4,0,29,29,,,
07700,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Man, not only does that make perfect sense, but Miss Sonia's beautiful voice is just so soothing...",4,4,0,30,30,,,
07701,Kazuichi,Trial 4,We've already settled this problem!,4,4,0,31,31,,,
07702,Kazuichi,Trial 4,Give it 10 years before you argue with Miss Sonia!,4,4,0,32,32,,,
07703,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Hajime, I won't tolerate any sort of rebellion!",4,4,0,33,33,,,
07704,Kazuichi,Trial 4,It's... probably some kinda trick like the floor rotating 180 degrees or something...,4,4,0,34,34,,,
07705,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"If it is then see, it could've passed as the exact same place, right?",4,4,0,35,35,,,
07706,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"I-it's alright, a fired up Miss Sonia is awesome to watch!",4,4,0,36,36,,,
07707,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"If they're not the same building or two different buildings, then what are they?",4,4,0,37,37,,,
07708,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Give us the answer, not a freaking hint!",4,4,0,38,38,,,
07709,Kazuichi,Trial 4,B-but what about the shape of the building? The two houses were completely different shapes!,4,4,0,39,39,,,
07710,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Aww, your precious hammies don't know? But it's so simple!",4,4,0,40,40,,,
07711,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Alrighty then, I'll be the one who solves this mystery in a flash! Please watch me, Miss Sonia.",4,4,0,41,41,,,
07712,Kazuichi,Trial 4,I'll definitely make her watch me! I'm gonna stand out til she notices me!,4,4,0,42,42,,,
07713,Kazuichi,Trial 4,I'm gonna solve this mystery in a flash!,4,4,0,43,43,,,
07714,Kazuichi,Trial 4,One of the bodies in one of the towers...,4,4,0,44,44,,,
07715,Kazuichi,Trial 4,...was actually a dummy!,4,4,0,45,45,,,
07716,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"N-no fair, you totally stole my spotlight!",4,4,0,46,46,,,
07717,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Shut up, just pick one of 'em!",4,4,0,47,47,,,
07718,Kazuichi,Trial 4,Huh? Me?,4,4,0,48,48,,,
07719,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Hehe, Miss Sonia, that's a pretty harsh joke...",4,4,0,49,49,,,
07720,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"You a-are joking, right?",4,4,0,50,50,,,
07721,Kazuichi,Trial 4,I'm... even more disappointed.,4,4,0,51,51,,,
07722,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Now that you mention it, sometimes when I pressed the door button it took a while for it to open.",4,4,0,52,52,,,
07723,Kazuichi,Trial 4,Why do we have to do that?,4,4,0,53,53,,,
07724,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"By the way, what does the chain on the far back door in Grape Tower mean?",4,4,0,54,54,,,
07725,Kazuichi,Trial 4,What a pain... It's fine already.,4,4,0,55,55,,,
07726,Kazuichi,Trial 4,What's with this iron curtain of teamwork?,4,4,0,56,56,,,
07727,Kazuichi,Trial 4,Huh? Me?,4,4,0,57,57,,,
07728,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Oh that. Yeah, it was pretty strange.",4,4,0,58,58,,,
07729,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"From start to finish, somehow the compass needle rotated 180 degrees.",4,4,0,59,59,,,
07730,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"But is it really okay to believe the building is the weapon? Nagito said it, y'know?",4,4,0,60,60,,,
07731,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Hold on, did you forget the elevator has a sensor?",4,4,0,61,61,,,
07732,Kazuichi,Trial 4,As long as there's a moving object inside...,4,4,0,62,62,,,
07733,Kazuichi,Trial 4,...the other door won't open!,4,4,0,63,63,,,
07734,Kazuichi,Trial 4,Which means the elevator wouldn't have moved either!,4,4,0,64,64,,,
07735,Kazuichi,Trial 4,Now you're calling me a pest!?,4,4,0,65,65,,,
07736,Kazuichi,Trial 4,How about we all shut up and listen to what Chiaki has to say?,4,4,0,66,66,,,
07737,Kazuichi,Trial 4,D-don't be so cold...,4,4,0,67,67,,,
07738,Kazuichi,Trial 4,What if I start to enjoy it?,4,4,0,68,68,,,
07739,Kazuichi,Trial 4,So what if they created a drop? There's no way you could make him fall and die with just that.,4,4,0,69,69,,,
07740,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"If Nekomaru is suspended in mid-air like that, then how do you get him to fall?",4,4,0,70,70,,,
07741,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Cuz if he's suspended in mid-air, he won't die if he doesn't actually fall.",4,4,0,71,71,,,
07742,Kazuichi,Trial 4,Even if they suspended Nekomaru from a wire...,4,4,0,72,72,,,
07743,Kazuichi,Trial 4,...how would they make him fall?,4,4,0,73,73,,,
07744,Kazuichi,Trial 4,There's no one in the tower to push him off!,4,4,0,74,74,,,
07745,Kazuichi,Trial 4,There's no way they could that!,4,4,0,75,75,,,
07746,Kazuichi,Trial 4,Wha-? Nekomaru fell on his own?,4,4,0,76,76,,,
07747,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Nekomaru should've still been in sleep mode, right?",4,4,0,77,77,,,
07748,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"If he was sleeping, there's no way he could do that to himself.",4,4,0,78,78,,,
07749,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Heh, now's the time if you wanna take back that sleep mode thing.",4,4,0,79,79,,,
07750,Kazuichi,Trial 4,But in that case...,4,4,0,80,80,,,
07751,Kazuichi,Trial 4,...you still won't be able to explain the drop.,4,4,0,81,81,,,
07752,Kazuichi,Trial 4,Moving the elevator with Nekomaru inside...,4,4,0,82,82,,,
07753,Kazuichi,Trial 4,...is just impossible! End of story!,4,4,0,83,83,,,
07754,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Wh-what are you saying? Like, how would he even wake up?",4,4,0,84,84,,,
07755,Kazuichi,Trial 4,I see. So that's how Nekomaru fell to his death.,4,4,0,85,85,,,
07756,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Yeah, it appears it's just as Miss Sonia said.",4,4,0,86,86,,,
07757,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"I'm just a pest... No, I'm not just a pest, I'm a total fucking pig!",4,4,0,87,87,,,
07758,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Isn't that right, Miss Sonia? If I'm a fucking pig, you can say so!",4,4,0,88,88,,,
07759,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Hey, why aren't you teasing me anymore?",4,4,0,89,89,,,
07760,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Nekomaru died because of that alarm, right?",4,4,0,90,90,,,
07761,Kazuichi,Trial 4,Maybe the clock Miss Sonia saw was the one that got tampered with.,4,4,0,91,91,,,
07762,Kazuichi,Trial 4,If the time in the building was all messed up...,4,4,0,92,92,,,
07763,Kazuichi,Trial 4,...then we can only rely on Nekomaru's radio clock.,4,4,0,93,93,,,
07764,Kazuichi,Trial 4,If only Nekomaru's alarm was loud enough...,4,4,0,94,94,,,
07765,Kazuichi,Trial 4,...we would've heard it too!,4,4,0,95,95,,,
07766,Kazuichi,Trial 4,We heard that noise too!,4,4,0,96,96,,,
07767,Kazuichi,Trial 4,You probably didn't hear it cuz you were sleeping.,4,4,0,97,97,,,
07768,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"There's nothing to worry about. What's important is that rumbling noise, anyway.",4,4,0,98,98,,,
07769,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Plus the Funhouse has no windows. And there weren't any Monokuma announcements, either.",4,4,0,99,99,,,
07770,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Hey, why would that decrease the number of suspects? Don't be a freaking liar!",4,4,0,100,100,,,
07771,Kazuichi,Trial 4,I... remember now.,4,4,0,101,101,,,
07772,Kazuichi,Trial 4,The sound was so loud I couldn't help bolting from my room. But there was one guy who never left the lounge...,4,4,0,102,102,,,
07773,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"We were both on the same floor, it's pretty weird that bastard never came out of his guest room.",4,4,0,103,103,,,
07774,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"That's right, Nagito wasn't there!",4,4,0,104,104,,,
07775,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"It was just me, Gundham and Fuyuhiko!",4,4,0,105,105,,,
07776,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"If that's the case, where were you?",4,4,0,106,106,,,
07777,Kazuichi,Trial 4,Y-you're definitely fucking lying!,4,4,0,107,107,,,
07778,Kazuichi,Trial 4,Huh? Now that you mention it...,4,4,0,108,108,,,
07779,Kazuichi,Trial 4,Like putting Nekomaru in sleep mode and tying him up with the wire.,4,4,0,109,109,,,
07780,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"And, once they tried to go back they couldn't because Fuyuhiko was at the lounge.",4,4,0,110,110,,,
07781,Kazuichi,Trial 4,If the elevator was broken at Grape House he wouldn't have been able to return to Strawberry House.,4,4,0,111,111,,,
07782,Kazuichi,Trial 4,A-are you serious? And here I thought it's already been decided.,4,4,0,112,112,,,
07783,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"Plus, the elevator was...",4,4,0,113,113,,,
07784,Kazuichi,Trial 4,...broken at Grape House.,4,4,0,114,114,,,
07785,Kazuichi,Trial 4,"No, that might not be it.",4,4,0,115,115,,,
07786,Kazuichi,Trial 5,D-don't say something so stupid! There's no way in hell I'm the traitor!,4,5,0,1,1,,,
07787,Kazuichi,Trial 5,The killer didn't tape Nagito's mouth to shut him up!,4,5,0,2,2,,,
07788,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"I'm telling you, they were torturing him!",4,5,0,3,3,,,
07789,Kazuichi,Trial 5,It's because the killer tortured Nagito!,4,5,0,4,4,,,
07790,Kazuichi,Trial 5,That was Fuyuhiko!,4,5,0,5,5,,,
07791,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"Ah, I just realized it! It's a trap!",4,5,0,6,6,,,
07792,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"Stupid Hajime, you got caught in that trap!",4,5,0,7,7,,,
07793,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"Like you said, if Nagito's mouth was taped shut...",4,5,0,8,8,,,
07794,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"...you'd obviously assume he couldn't talk, right?",4,5,0,9,9,,,
07795,Kazuichi,Trial 5,But that was the trap!,4,5,0,10,10,,,
07796,Kazuichi,Trial 5,They wanted to hide the fact that he got interrogated!,4,5,0,11,11,,,
07797,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"Pay attention, this is how it went down!",4,5,0,12,12,,,
07798,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"First, the killer tortured Nagito...",4,5,0,13,13,,,
07799,Kazuichi,Trial 5,...and got information about the bombd's location.,4,5,0,14,14,,,
07800,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"Then, after they killed him...",4,5,0,15,15,,,
07801,Kazuichi,Trial 5,...they duct taped his mouth shut!,4,5,0,16,16,,,
07802,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"Phew, that was close you guys.",4,5,0,17,17,,,
07803,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"Thanks to me, you guys didn't get caught in the trap.",4,5,0,18,18,,,
07804,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Wh-what did you say?,4,5,0,19,19,,,
07805,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Why do you always side with Hajime? Do you have a crush on him or something?,4,5,0,20,20,,,
07806,Kazuichi,Trial 5,We can't think of any other reason.,4,5,0,21,21,,,
07807,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"The killer isn't one of us but that's not the case, huh? I mean, that's wishful thinking.",4,5,0,22,22,,,
07808,Kazuichi,Trial 5,That's our Miss Sonia. You have such an amazingly high intellect.,4,5,0,23,23,,,
07809,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"Alrighty then, let's think about this based on what Miss Sonia thinks. Is that okay, Miss sonia?",4,5,0,24,24,,,
07810,Kazuichi,Trial 5,The killer used some kind of setup...,4,5,0,25,25,,,
07811,Kazuichi,Trial 5,...and lit the curtain on fire with the lighter!,4,5,0,26,26,,,
07812,Kazuichi,Trial 5,If they tipped over the lighter in some way...,4,5,0,27,27,,,
07813,Kazuichi,Trial 5,...it could've ignited the curtain!,4,5,0,28,28,,,
07814,Kazuichi,Trial 5,There should've been a way to tip it over with soundwaves.,4,5,0,29,29,,,
07815,Kazuichi,Trial 5,So the reason the warehouse was dark was to hide the domino effect.,4,5,0,30,30,,,
07816,Kazuichi,Trial 5,You don't look so sure.,4,5,0,31,31,,,
07817,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Not just a victim? What does that mean?,4,5,0,32,32,,,
07818,Kazuichi,Trial 5,You couldn't do much with the free arm.,4,5,0,33,33,,,
07819,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Dirty joke! Is that a dirty joke?,4,5,0,34,34,,,
07820,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"It's impossible to stab a knife into your right hand with your right hand. Gah, that much is obvious.",4,5,0,35,35,,,
07821,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"I, I-I see. So that's the trick.",4,5,0,36,36,,,
07822,Kazuichi,Trial 5,He probably thought the fire would incinerate it and destroy the evidence.,4,5,0,37,37,,,
07823,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"I'm sorry, I didn't catch all that...",4,5,0,38,38,,,
07824,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"Ah, say it one more time... I need to record it... for reasons.",4,5,0,39,39,,,
07825,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"But it's just as Monokuma said, we've been betrayed over and over again so far, so...",4,5,0,40,40,,,
07826,Kazuichi,Trial 5,...this might also be the same. Calling this a suicide takes too much for granted and it's too convenient.,4,5,0,41,41,,,
07827,Kazuichi,Trial 5,O-of course that doesn't include Miss Sonia and me.,4,5,0,42,42,,,
07828,Kazuichi,Trial 5,But you said it too! It'd be impossible to stab himself with the spear in his condition.,4,5,0,43,43,,,
07829,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Wh-what kind of way?,4,5,0,44,44,,,
07830,Kazuichi,Trial 5,He was only able to move his left hand.,4,5,0,45,45,,,
07831,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Then that rules out his left hand.,4,5,0,46,46,,,
07832,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"If that's the case, the only other way is...",4,5,0,47,47,,,
07833,Kazuichi,Trial 5,A blushing Miss Sonia is freaking awesome!,4,5,0,48,48,,,
07834,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"Wh-why? I mean, his left hand was tied up, y'know?",4,5,0,49,49,,,
07835,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Huh? Really?,4,5,0,50,50,,,
07836,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"You're not gonna say he gripped the tip of the cord, swung the spear around and stabbed himself, right?",4,5,0,51,51,,,
07837,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Hmm...,4,5,0,52,52,,,
07838,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Perpendicular... in the middle of the air?,4,5,0,53,53,,,
07839,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Are you serious? He... really committed suicide like that?,4,5,0,54,54,,,
07840,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Did he need to go that far?,4,5,0,55,55,,,
07841,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Th-that's beyond crazy! Why would he do that to himself?,4,5,0,56,56,,,
07842,Kazuichi,Trial 5,That's messed up. That's seriously so messed up.,4,5,0,57,57,,,
07843,Kazuichi,Trial 5,He was probably planning to kill the traitor along with the rest of us!,4,5,0,58,58,,,
07844,Kazuichi,Trial 5,He tried to make us doubt each other to try to hide the truth behind his suicide,4,5,0,59,59,,,
07845,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"Then, it's okay to end it here, huh?",4,5,0,60,60,,,
07846,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"That means we're done with this class trial and we can leave this island, right?",4,5,0,61,61,,,
07847,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"It's okay to reach such a happy ending, right?",4,5,0,62,62,,,
07848,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Y-you're gonna keep going? And here I thought we were finally finished.,4,5,0,63,63,,,
07849,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Maybe it's not included if it's not important enough to write about.,4,5,0,64,64,,,
07850,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Y-you guys who said it was a suicide in the first place!,4,5,0,65,65,,,
07851,Kazuichi,Trial 5,This is freaking annoying!,4,5,0,66,66,,,
07852,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"But if you guys say you're doing it, there's no way I'm gonna back out!",4,5,0,67,67,,,
07853,Kazuichi,Trial 5,If you think the cuts on his legs and his left arm aren't the fatal wounds...,4,5,0,68,68,,,
07854,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"...it's not the knife in his right hand, right?",4,5,0,69,69,,,
07855,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"It's not the other wounds, right?",4,5,0,70,70,,,
07856,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"Just thinking about it, that's already a horrible death.",4,5,0,71,71,,,
07857,Kazuichi,Trial 5,P-p-poison?,4,5,0,72,72,,,
07858,Kazuichi,Trial 5,I see. You sure seem to know a lot about medicine.,4,5,0,73,73,,,
07859,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"But still, both of Nagito's hands were full so how would he drink poison?",4,5,0,74,74,,,
07860,Kazuichi,Trial 5,You're totally over-valuing that tail!,4,5,0,75,75,,,
07861,Kazuichi,Trial 5,He breathed that poisonous gas inside the warehouse?,4,5,0,76,76,,,
07862,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"But if poisonous gas had spread throughout the warehouse, why didn't it kill us?",4,5,0,77,77,,,
07863,Kazuichi,Trial 5,So what?,4,5,0,78,78,,,
07864,Kazuichi,Trial 5,We figured out that Nagito died from poison but... so what?,4,5,0,79,79,,,
07865,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"In the end, it doesn't change the fact that he commited suicide, right? Then enough already!",4,5,0,80,80,,,
07866,Kazuichi,Trial 5,What? There's still more?,4,5,0,81,81,,,
07867,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"Like, does that really matter all that much?",4,5,0,82,82,,,
07868,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"I mean, even if he had an accomplice it doesn't change the fact that Nagito still committed suicide.",4,5,0,83,83,,,
07869,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Right? Isn't it okay to close this case yet? I'm not in the mood for unexpected twists.,4,5,0,84,84,,,
07870,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Huh?,4,5,0,85,85,,,
07871,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"I mean, it'd be a suicide regardless, right?",4,5,0,86,86,,,
07872,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Seriously? That's impossible! Miss Sonia just said so right now!,4,5,0,87,87,,,
07873,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"S-so, what's the issue?",4,5,0,88,88,,,
07874,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"Nagito put the poison in the grenade canister, brought it with him, breathed it in and died, right?",4,5,0,89,89,,,
07875,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"So in the end, he still fucking committed suicide. Enough already!",4,5,0,90,90,,,
07876,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Wh-what the hell? Do you still wanna keep going?,4,5,0,91,91,,,
07877,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Wh-what the heck?,4,5,0,92,92,,,
07878,Kazuichi,Trial 5,What the heck?,4,5,0,93,93,,,
07879,Kazuichi,Trial 5,But you said so yourself! You said Nagito committed suicide!,4,5,0,94,94,,,
07880,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Huh?,4,5,0,95,95,,,
07881,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Wh-wh-wh-wha-?,4,5,0,96,96,,,
07882,Kazuichi,Trial 5,What the heeell!?,4,5,0,97,97,,,
07883,Kazuichi,Trial 5,Th-that's totally messed up. That's so fucked up!,4,5,0,98,98,,,
07884,Kazuichi,Trial 5,I-it's not Miss Sonia's fault. This is all Nagito's doing.,4,5,0,99,99,,,
07885,Kazuichi,Trial 5,That's right. There's no way you'd be able to figure that out with just your surveillance cameras.,4,5,0,100,100,,,
07886,Kazuichi,Trial 5,If Monokuma doesn't know this trial doesn't coun't! Isn't that right?,4,5,0,101,101,,,

07889,Kazuichi,Trial 5,"What do you mean, ""believe""?",4,5,0,104,104,,,
07890,Kazuichi,Trial 5,I guess the last thing he could believe in was his own talent.,4,5,0,105,105,,,
07891,Kazuichi,Trial 5,He risked his life for that?,4,5,0,106,106,,,

08140,Gundham,Trial 1,"No, unfortunately. There was nothing related to the incident under the floorboards.",3,1,0,33,33,,,
08141,Gundham,Trial 1,"The only thing I found was a strange liquid shining in the darkness, near where Byakuya's blood was dripping...",3,1,0,34,34,,,
08142,Gundham,Trial 1,"Also, if they stabbed from under the floorboards the weapon would have to be at least 50 centimeters in length.",3,1,0,35,35,,,
08143,Gundham,Trial 1,"The sword of destruction, encased in bone and sheated in meat! It brought catastrophy onto Byakuya!",3,1,0,36,36,,,
08144,Gundham,Trial 2,The outcome of this trial should be determined by whether or not we find Mahiru's killer.,3,2,0,1,1,,,
08145,Gundham,Trial 2,"Hey, you said the game was a work of non-fiction. That means, Fuyuhiko's little sister is...",3,2,0,2,2,,,
08146,Gundham,Trial 2,"Girl A is Mikan, Girl B is Hiyoko, Girl C is Ibuki, Girl D is Mahiru, Guy F is Fuyuhiko...",3,2,0,3,3,,,
08147,Gundham,Trial 2,"...and the first victim in the girl, that dead highschool girl, is Fuyuhiko's little sister.",3,2,0,4,4,,,
08148,Gundham,Trial 2,Tanaka may be an ordinary family name but it's far better than Sato or Suzuki.,3,2,0,5,5,,,
08149,Gundham,Trial 2,She just broke the window in the music room...,3,2,0,6,6,,,
08150,Gundham,Trial 2,...and escaped outside!,3,2,0,7,7,,,
08151,Gundham,Trial 2,Then the piano!,3,2,0,8,8,,,
08152,Gundham,Trial 2,The investigation conducts universal chaos!,3,2,0,9,9,,,
08153,Gundham,Trial 2,"A scenario where Guy F kills Girl E out of a burning, hellfire desire to avenge his murdered sister!",3,2,0,10,10,,,
08154,Gundham,Trial 2,"Hmm, so you finally decided to confess...",3,2,0,11,11,,,
08155,Gundham,Trial 2,"I see, so Hiyoko was able to arrange a meeting with Mahiru by exchanging letters with her.",3,2,0,12,12,,,
08156,Gundham,Trial 2,"Kehehehe, I have captured the true character of this mystery!",3,2,0,13,13,,,
08157,Gundham,Trial 2,Hiyoko who summoned Mahiru to the beach house hid inside the closet like a familiar!,3,2,0,14,14,,,

08159,Gundham,Trial 2,"Fuhahahaha, we have presented the proof. My Four Dark Devas of Destruction didn't even need to come out!",3,2,0,16,16,,,

08161,Gundham,Trial 2,I shall render my verdict upon this mystery's conclusion.,3,2,0,18,18,,,
08162,Gundham,Trial 2,Hiyoko is the sinner who killed Mahiru!,3,2,0,19,19,,,
08163,Gundham,Trial 2,"In doing so, they were able to control Hiyoko and Mahiru to do their bidding... Like a netherworld puppeteer.",3,2,0,20,20,,,
08164,Gundham,Trial 2,So their reason for blocking the door with Mahiru's body was to make Hiyoko leave her footprints as evidence!,3,2,0,21,21,,,
08165,Gundham,Trial 2,"Your stance is neither white nor black but gray, and you do not yearn for your life or even for victory...",3,2,0,22,22,,,
08166,Gundham,Trial 2,They wouldn't have to do something that troublesome as long as they hid somewhere within the beach house.,3,2,0,23,23,,,
08167,Gundham,Trial 2,"However, before we proceed any further, there's something we have to make clear.",3,2,0,24,24,,,
08168,Gundham,Trial 2,"The killer blocked the roadside door with Mahiru's body before Hiyoko ran away, but what about the blood?",3,2,0,25,25,,,
08169,Gundham,Trial 2,"Let me ask, who might that be?",3,2,0,26,26,,,
08170,Gundham,Trial 2,"Among flowers, the cherry blossom. Among men, the samurai! I commend your decisiveness, at least.",3,2,0,27,27,,,

08173,Gundham,Trial 2,What!?,3,2,0,30,30,,,
08174,Gundham,Trial 3,If Ibuki committed suicide then who killed Hiyoko?,3,3,0,1,1,,,
08175,Gundham,Trial 3,"Then let's ask Hajime, how long would you say you were away from the music venue?",3,3,0,2,2,,,
08176,Gundham,Trial 3,It seems they were trying to stall for time.,3,3,0,3,3,,,
08177,Gundham,Trial 3,"So, during the ten minute Hajime left the venue, the killer murdered Hiyoko and created a closed space?",3,3,0,4,4,,,
08178,Gundham,Trial 3,"Hmm, that scrap of paper... Is that what we found in the baton lighting at the music venue?",3,3,0,5,5,,,
08179,Gundham,Trial 3,But it would've taken quite a long time to tape up a hidden body...,3,3,0,6,6,,,
08180,Gundham,Trial 3,What? They hid the pillar?,3,3,0,7,7,,,
08181,Gundham,Trial 3,"It's as if both crimes were replicas of scenes from the movie, although the mutilated tin man was omitted.",3,3,0,8,8,,,
08182,Gundham,Trial 3,A valid line of reasoning.,3,3,0,9,9,,,
08183,Gundham,Trial 3,What do you mean?,3,3,0,10,10,,,
08184,Gundham,Trial 3,"Hmph, if you're going to cry and beg like that then I guess I'll hear about the condition of Ibuki's body.",3,3,0,11,11,,,
08185,Gundham,Trial 3,"I'll let you sob as much as you want later, just hurry up before I change my mind!",3,3,0,12,12,,,
08186,Gundham,Trial 3,An even bigger jerk? Impossible!,3,3,0,13,13,,,
08187,Gundham,Trial 3,What's wrong with that?,3,3,0,14,14,,,
08188,Gundham,Trial 3,"Kehehehe, how light. Your words are so light, as light as the sylph's feather.",3,3,0,15,15,,,
08189,Gundham,Trial 3,"Fuhahahaha, your opponent is out of your league. It is too absurd to try and perplex me so inadequately.",3,3,0,16,16,,,
08190,Gundham,Trial 3,"First and foremost, you claim Ibuki's feet were touching the floor when Hiyoko was killed...",3,3,0,17,17,,,
08191,Gundham,Trial 3,How can a low-class creature with no psychic abilities know something like that?,3,3,0,18,18,,,
08192,Gundham,Trial 3,It seems you suffer from a pathetic delusion!,3,3,0,19,19,,,
08193,Gundham,Trial 3,I am telling you to present your evidence!,3,3,0,20,20,,,
08194,Gundham,Trial 3,"Weak, weak, weak I say!",3,3,0,21,21,,,
08195,Gundham,Trial 3,It doesn't even pierce my heart!,3,3,0,22,22,,,
08196,Gundham,Trial 3,"Fuhahahaha, is that it? A sheppard dressed in his Sunday's finest still reeks of lamb, Hajime Hinata!",3,3,0,23,23,,,
08197,Gundham,Trial 3,"""Does that mean you have a rebuttal?"" Hmm, that's a good line...",3,3,0,24,24,,,

08199,Gundham,Trial 3,You're so frightened you can't even make a sound. It seems you've realized our difference in status.,3,3,0,26,26,,,
08200,Gundham,Trial 3,"However, the time for conviction starts now! You better entertain me to the fullest!",3,3,0,27,27,,,
08201,Gundham,Trial 3,You're saying the blood on Ibuki's feet belonged to Hiyoko?,3,3,0,28,28,,,
08202,Gundham,Trial 3,"Hah, impossible!",3,3,0,29,29,,,
08203,Gundham,Trial 3,Try to remember the crime scene!,3,3,0,30,30,,,
08204,Gundham,Trial 3,There was no blood on the floor!,3,3,0,31,31,,,
08205,Gundham,Trial 3,You can't step on blood that was never there.,3,3,0,32,32,,,
08206,Gundham,Trial 3,"Kehehehe, just about one minute.",3,3,0,33,33,,,
08207,Gundham,Trial 3,Did you see a nice nightmare?,3,3,0,34,34,,,
08208,Gundham,Trial 3,"Hiyoko was taped to the pillar, yes?",3,3,0,35,35,,,
08209,Gundham,Trial 3,Then it's possible that the pillar still had blood on it.,3,3,0,36,36,,,
08210,Gundham,Trial 3,"However, you cannot step on the pillar with your feet!",3,3,0,37,37,,,
08211,Gundham,Trial 3,"Kehehehehe, you should feel proud of yourself.",3,3,0,38,38,,,
08212,Gundham,Trial 3,It's been nearly three years since I've had to use 60% of my power.,3,3,0,39,39,,,
08213,Gundham,Trial 3,D-don't say such foolish things! You don't have proof of that at all!,3,3,0,40,40,,,
08214,Gundham,Trial 3,It appears that... it it wiser to retreat for now...,3,3,0,41,41,,,
08215,Gundham,Trial 3,"Fine then, but regardless of good or evil there is no deceit in upholding ones convictions.",3,3,0,42,42,,,
08216,Gundham,Trial 3,What time did Hajime see that video?,3,3,0,43,43,,,
08217,Gundham,Trial 3,That's not an alibi!,3,3,0,44,44,,,
08218,Gundham,Trial 3,So it's inevitable that an alibi for both before and during the morning announcement would be very important.,3,3,0,45,45,,,
08219,Gundham,Trial 3,"That's the one Hiyoko's body was imitating, right?",3,3,0,46,46,,,
08220,Gundham,Trial 3,What are you trying to say? Are you saying the imitation wasn't planned?,3,3,0,47,47,,,
08221,Gundham,Trial 3,Whaaat?,3,3,0,48,48,,,
08222,Gundham,Trial 3,"However, this is getting quite interesting. My Four Dark Devas of Destruction are getting riled up!",3,3,0,49,49,,,
08223,Gundham,Trial 3,Or...,3,3,0,50,50,,,
08224,Gundham,Trial 3,...she was guided by the will of causality!,3,3,0,51,51,,,
08225,Gundham,Trial 3,Though that may not apply for Sonia since she provided Hiyoko with that information.,3,3,0,52,52,,,
08226,Gundham,Trial 3,"Hmph, Kazuichi. It seems you have quite the fashion sense.",3,3,0,53,53,,,
08227,Gundham,Trial 3,Do you want me to incinerate your clothes? Perhaps I could do that while you're wearing them!,3,3,0,54,54,,,
08228,Gundham,Trial 3,"Of course, I've already overlooked no less that ten opportunities to kill you!",3,3,0,55,55,,,
08229,Gundham,Trial 3,Which means that low-down scoundrel didn't plan on committing imitation murders at first.,3,3,0,56,56,,,
08230,Gundham,Trial 3,"I see, so there was some kind of trick arranged in that video, hm?",3,3,0,57,57,,,
08231,Gundham,Trial 3,But where would you find another stepladder? There was only one stepladder in the music venue.,3,3,0,58,58,,,
08232,Gundham,Trial 3,"Then, there's a possibility that the killer also tampered with the surveillance camera unit!",3,3,0,59,59,,,
08233,Gundham,Trial 3,"Despite Kazuichi's desperate repair effort, it seems it could not transmit from the hospital to the motel.",3,3,0,60,60,,,
08234,Gundham,Trial 3,Where they might have tampered with the camera...,3,3,0,61,61,,,
08235,Gundham,Trial 3,You fiend! Are you saying you already know who the killer is?,3,3,0,62,62,,,
08236,Gundham,Trial 3,So that must mean...,3,3,0,63,63,,,
08237,Gundham,Trial 3,I agree. It is truly difficult someone could be killed by such a slow-witted woman.,3,3,0,64,64,,,
08238,Gundham,Trial 3,Do you still believe this woman is the killer?,3,3,0,65,65,,,
08239,Gundham,Trial 3,"Hey, what are you trying to say?",3,3,0,66,66,,,
08240,Gundham,Trial 3,The Monokuma File complicates this too.,3,3,0,67,67,,,
08241,Gundham,Trial 3,It never specified hanging or strangulation.,3,3,0,68,68,,,
08242,Gundham,Trial 3,That's not it?,3,3,0,69,69,,,
08243,Gundham,Trial 4,"Thinking we should at least find some method to communicate, we set our sights on the lounge telephone.",3,4,0,1,1,,,
08244,Gundham,Trial 4,It seems that was a waste of time.,3,4,0,2,2,,,
08245,Gundham,Trial 4,Nobody could withstand a blow from that pillar.,3,4,0,3,3,,,
08246,Gundham,Trial 4,Even if you used 100% of your muscle strength it would be impossible to wield it as a weapon!,3,4,0,4,4,,,
08247,Gundham,Trial 4,"You mean, Nekomaru killed himself?",3,4,0,5,5,,,
08248,Gundham,Trial 4,If the pillar was not lifted...,3,4,0,6,6,,,
08249,Gundham,Trial 4,...beating him with it is beyond a dream!,3,4,0,7,7,,,
08250,Gundham,Trial 4,"Then I shall ask you, what way is that?",3,4,0,8,8,,,
08251,Gundham,Trial 4,A specific item?,3,4,0,9,9,,,
08252,Gundham,Trial 4,"That's right, you've seen it clearly.",3,4,0,10,10,,,
08253,Gundham,Trial 4,"Because I, the one who was claimed dominion over evil, am the Ultimate Weapon!",3,4,0,11,11,,,
08254,Gundham,Trial 4,I am He who cuts the insolent catalyst which flows out from the chaos with a sword of victory!,3,4,0,12,12,,,

08257,Gundham,Trial 4,You took a picture?,3,4,0,15,15,,,
08258,Gundham,Trial 4,It's not? Are you saying that Grape House is merely an illusion spell cast by Monokuma's Cursed Eye?,3,4,0,16,16,,,
08259,Gundham,Trial 4,"Same building, different floors?",3,4,0,17,17,,,
08260,Gundham,Trial 4,"However, if they're different floors within the same building, why was Nekomaru in both places?",3,4,0,18,18,,,
08261,Gundham,Trial 4,Nekomaru died with a mechanical body...,3,4,0,19,19,,,
08262,Gundham,Trial 4,...it should be possible to construct a body from spare parts!,3,4,0,20,20,,,
08263,Gundham,Trial 4,"However, even if Nekomaru's body wasn't a dummy, it's meaningless if we don't have the important answer.",3,4,0,21,21,,,
08264,Gundham,Trial 4,What? Are you saying Nekomaru's body was transported using an elevator?,3,4,0,22,22,,,
08265,Gundham,Trial 4,"If the room just moves up and down like an elevator, there's no reason for the doors to change.",3,4,0,23,23,,,
08266,Gundham,Trial 4,"Hmph, there are too many strange things. Was that tower really an elevator?",3,4,0,24,24,,,
08267,Gundham,Trial 4,What did you say?,3,4,0,25,25,,,
08268,Gundham,Trial 4,"Hold on, you're progressing much too quickly. There's still a contradiction concerning the building structure.",3,4,0,26,26,,,
08269,Gundham,Trial 4,"You said earlier that Strawberry House and Grape House are connected vertically, right?",3,4,0,27,27,,,
08270,Gundham,Trial 4,"If so, how does the contact elevator supposedly transport us from one house to the other?",3,4,0,28,28,,,
08271,Gundham,Trial 4,If that elevator moves vertically...,3,4,0,29,29,,,
08272,Gundham,Trial 4,"...then, when your back is facing the elevator, both towers should be on the same side!",3,4,0,30,30,,,
08273,Gundham,Trial 4,"But, does this reflect reality?",3,4,0,31,31,,,
08274,Gundham,Trial 4,"Inside Grape House, Grape Hall is on your right when your back is to the elevator...",3,4,0,32,32,,,

08276,Gundham,Trial 4,"Which means, the houses are on exact opposite sides of the tower. ",3,4,0,34,34,,,
08277,Gundham,Trial 4,"Answer me, fiend! What does this mean?",3,4,0,35,35,,,
08278,Gundham,Trial 4,If the two houses are connected vertically...,3,4,0,36,36,,,
08279,Gundham,Trial 4,"...vertically, not horizontally!",3,4,0,37,37,,,
08280,Gundham,Trial 4,"Which means, your reasoning...",3,4,0,38,38,,,
08281,Gundham,Trial 4,"Kehehehe, you say such falsehoods per usual.",3,4,0,39,39,,,
08282,Gundham,Trial 4,There is no such thing as murder for the sake of hope. Murder is simply murder.,3,4,0,40,40,,,
08283,Gundham,Trial 4,"Forcibly sacrificing others for ones's own desires, even one as diabolical as I would avoid such actions!",3,4,0,41,41,,,
08284,Gundham,Trial 4,Died from falling?,3,4,0,42,42,,,

08286,Gundham,Trial 4,Where in that building would you even be able to push someone off in the first place?,3,4,0,44,44,,,
08287,Gundham,Trial 4,"Fuhahahaha, saying he died from falling is truly incorrect! You should burn in the flames of hell!",3,4,0,45,45,,,
08288,Gundham,Trial 4,That must be the threshold of that elevator.,3,4,0,46,46,,,
08289,Gundham,Trial 4,"However, even if they moved the elevator in that manner, Nekomaru would've just moved along with it.",3,4,0,47,47,,,
08290,Gundham,Trial 4,"There would have been no drop for him to fall and die from, yes?",3,4,0,48,48,,,
08291,Gundham,Trial 4,What about the oil on the floor?,3,4,0,49,49,,,
08292,Gundham,Trial 4,So that's how the pillar shattered and why oil was spilled all over the place!,3,4,0,50,50,,,
08293,Gundham,Trial 4,It appears yet another contradiction has been birthed.,3,4,0,51,51,,,
08294,Gundham,Trial 4,How were you able to discover Nekomaru died at 7:30 AM when you went to the tower at 7?,3,4,0,52,52,,,
08295,Gundham,Trial 4,His time of death and the time the body was discovered...,3,4,0,53,53,,,
08296,Gundham,Trial 4,...one of those must be an illusion!,3,4,0,54,54,,,
08297,Gundham,Trial 4,If there's no possibility that the time was tampered with then we must doubt that human's testimony.,3,4,0,55,55,,,

08602,Twogami,CG,What the hell? What's going on here?,2,99,0,70,70,,,
08603,Twogami,CG,Th-this is-!,2,99,0,71,71,,,
08604,Twogami,CG,That's enough.,2,99,0,72,72,,,
08605,Twogami,CG,Ourselves.,2,99,0,101,101,,,
08606,Twogami,CG,Being brought to a tropical island with complete strangers in order to kill each other to escape...,2,99,0,102,102,,,
08607,Twogami,CG,"...that creates fear in our minds, and the desire to escape that hopeless fear...",2,99,0,103,103,,,
08608,Twogami,CG,...is our worst enemy.,2,99,0,104,104,,,
08609,Twogami,CG,How in the world did you end up in such a... compromising position after tripping?,2,99,0,105,105,,,
08610,Twogami,CG,"No, ah'm not!",2,99,0,106,106,,,
08611,Twogami,CG,"I'm telling you, I'm not-! Look carefully at this dish.",2,99,0,107,107,,,
08612,Twogami,CG,And just is stabbed into this roasted meat?,2,99,0,108,108,,,
08613,Twogami,CG,"That's right, this iron skewer is definitely a dangerous item. I must take full responsibility and collect it.",2,99,0,109,109,,,
08614,Mikan,Trial 1,Y-you're telling us to begin but... what are we supposed to do?,13,1,0,1,1,,,
08615,Mikan,Trial 1,"Oh, s-so that's why we found duct tape there...",13,1,0,2,2,,,
08616,Mikan,Trial 1,Does that mean... the killer planted them in advance?,13,1,0,3,3,,,
08617,Mikan,Trial 1,But... w-with Peko's height I don't think she'd be able to reach the circuit breaker in the office...,13,1,0,4,4,,,
08618,Mikan,Trial 1,L-laxatives?,13,1,0,5,5,,,
08619,Mikan,Trial 1,Let's just dismiss Peko's stomach ache as a coincidence a-and go back to discussing the blackout...,13,1,0,6,6,,,
08620,Mikan,Trial 1,T-trashy skank?,13,1,0,7,7,,,
08621,Mikan,Trial 1,They probably messed with the breaker...,13,1,0,8,8,,,
08622,Mikan,Trial 1,"By the way, I'm not a trashy skank!",13,1,0,9,9,,,
08623,Mikan,Trial 1,"M-me too! Please, take me home already!",13,1,0,10,10,,,
08624,Mikan,Trial 1,P-power cord?,13,1,0,11,11,,,
08625,Mikan,Trial 1,H-huh? Wh-what?,13,1,0,12,12,,,
08626,Mikan,Trial 1,"P-p-please, wait!",13,1,0,13,13,,,
08627,Mikan,Trial 1,U-umm... Umm... Umm... How should I put this...,13,1,0,14,14,,,
08628,Mikan,Trial 1,I-is Nagito really the killer...?,13,1,0,15,15,,,
08629,Mikan,Trial 1,I a-already know that but... Nhhh... There's just something a little strange...,13,1,0,16,16,,,
08630,Mikan,Trial 1,A-a-aaah! I-I'm sorry!,13,1,0,17,17,,,
08631,Mikan,Trial 1,I-I think it's strange that...,13,1,0,18,18,,,
08632,Mikan,Trial 1,...u-umm...,13,1,0,19,19,,,
08633,Mikan,Trial 1,"Umm, y'know...",13,1,0,20,20,,,
08634,Mikan,Trial 1,"Oh, nevermind...",13,1,0,21,21,,,
08635,Mikan,Trial 1,"But... based on the entrance wound on Byakuya's body, the actual weapon should be roughly 5 milimeters in diameter...",13,1,0,22,22,,,
08636,Mikan,Trial 1,Hyaaa! Not a wh-whorehouse!,13,1,0,23,23,,,
08637,Mikan,Trial 1,I-I'm sorry!,13,1,0,24,24,,,
08638,Mikan,Trial 1,B-but... there's another reason why I don't think Nagito is the killer...,13,1,0,25,25,,,
08639,Mikan,Trial 1,"Based on what we've discussed, Nagito was killer under the table, right?",13,1,0,26,26,,,
08640,Mikan,Trial 1,"W-well, even if that's true, I feel Nagito looks... y'know, clean.",13,1,0,27,27,,,
08641,Mikan,Trial 1,Ngh... I'm not talking about your looks!,13,1,0,28,28,,,
08642,Mikan,Trial 1,"Y-yes, that's it!",13,1,0,29,29,,,
08643,Mikan,Trial 1,"Because... under the table there was a lot of blood splattered everywhere, right?",13,1,0,30,30,,,
08644,Mikan,Trial 1,There were even bloodstains on the inside of the tablecloth.,13,1,0,31,31,,,
08645,Mikan,Trial 1,Even the inside of the tablecloth was bloody so there's no denying Byakuya was killed there...,13,1,0,32,32,,,
08646,Mikan,Trial 1,During the party... It was probably during the blackout.,13,1,0,33,33,,,
08647,Mikan,Trial 1,It... definitely sounds impossible!,13,1,0,34,34,,,
08648,Mikan,Trial 1,"C-can you explain this, Teruteru?",13,1,0,35,35,,,
08649,Mikan,Trial 1,Hyaaaaa!,13,1,0,36,36,,,
08650,Mikan,Trial 1,Ngh-! Don't make me remember! It's so embarrassing!,13,1,0,37,37,,,
08651,Mikan,Trial 1,Uhh! I'm sorry! I-I'm so sorry! I showed you something so... unsightly...,13,1,0,38,38,,,
08652,Mikan,Trial 1,"Judging from Byakuya's wounds, it was a thin, edged tool that's roughly 5 milimeters in diameter.",13,1,0,39,39,,,
08653,Mikan,Trial 1,An iron skewer would match up with the wounds perfectly!,13,1,0,40,40,,,
08654,Mikan,Trial 2,A-ahhh! M-me?,13,2,0,1,1,,,
08655,Mikan,Trial 2,Wh-why am I in a video game? That's an infringement on my right of privacy!,13,2,0,2,2,,,
08656,Mikan,Trial 2,"B-but it wasn't a pervert, right? Wasn't the real killer Girl E...?",13,2,0,3,3,,,
08657,Mikan,Trial 2,"Plus, at the entrance hall...",13,2,0,4,4,,,
08658,Mikan,Trial 2,...th-the other four girls should've been there.,13,2,0,5,5,,,
08659,Mikan,Trial 2,I-I see! Now the mystery has been solved!,13,2,0,6,6,,,
08660,Mikan,Trial 2,Was there a weapon with bloodstains on it?,13,2,0,7,7,,,
08661,Mikan,Trial 2,A bag? Wh-what kind of bag?,13,2,0,8,8,,,
08662,Mikan,Trial 2,"She probably made her uncnonscious by accident, and from there she couldn't go back...",13,2,0,9,9,,,
08663,Mikan,Trial 2,I-I somewhat understand that feeling...,13,2,0,10,10,,,
08664,Mikan,Trial 2,"Th-that is... I'm terribly sorry, but...",13,2,0,11,11,,,
08665,Mikan,Trial 2,Don't decide that based on ugliness!,13,2,0,12,12,,,
08666,Mikan,Trial 2,A different entrance... Are you talking about the door facing the road that Mahiru's body was leaning against?,13,2,0,13,13,,,
08667,Mikan,Trial 2,"Th-that letter! It's the one Mahiru had, right?",13,2,0,14,14,,,
08668,Mikan,Trial 2,The one with the mask?,13,2,0,15,15,,,
08669,Mikan,Trial 2,"At the time, the door facing the road...",13,2,0,16,16,,,
08670,Mikan,Trial 2,...was blocked by the body.,13,2,0,17,17,,,
08671,Mikan,Trial 2,So you were forced to leave from the beach side entrance.,13,2,0,18,18,,,
08672,Mikan,Trial 2,Huh? But what about the lemon flavor?,13,2,0,19,19,,,
08673,Mikan,Trial 2,"Th-the gummy at the crime scene was yellow, so it obviously looked like it was lemon-flavored.",13,2,0,20,20,,,
08674,Mikan,Trial 2,"You're talking about the footprints near the beach house, right?",13,2,0,21,21,,,
08675,Mikan,Trial 2,"According to my autopsy, yes. There's no doubt that Mahiru died instantly.",13,2,0,22,22,,,
08676,Mikan,Trial 2,Hiiii! I-I'm sorry!,13,2,0,23,23,,,
08677,Mikan,Trial 2,S-someone else?,13,2,0,24,24,,,
08678,Mikan,Trial 2,"Hiyoko, please don't cry. Everything is fine now, right?",13,2,0,25,25,,,
08679,Mikan,Trial 2,Ahh! I'm sorry for being pig-barf!,13,2,0,26,26,,,
08680,Mikan,Trial 2,Th-the killer forged both of those letters!,13,2,0,27,27,,,
08681,Mikan,Trial 2,W-why'd you fall asleep?,13,2,0,28,28,,,
08682,Mikan,Trial 2,Th-that medicine... Could it be? Did they get it from the drugstore?,13,2,0,29,29,,,
08683,Mikan,Trial 2,"I thought that place seemed unsafe, they even have prescription medicines laying out in the open...",13,2,0,30,30,,,
08684,Mikan,Trial 2,Hiiii! I-I'm sorry...,13,2,0,31,31,,,
08685,Mikan,Trial 2,E-everything was done to frame Hiyoko as the killer!,13,2,0,32,32,,,
08686,Mikan,Trial 2,"U-Umm... We were just saying the killer was hiding in the surfboard case, right?",13,2,0,33,33,,,
08687,Mikan,Trial 2,Maybe it's the other way around?,13,2,0,34,34,,,
08688,Mikan,Trial 2,Perhaps someone other than the killer moved the body?,13,2,0,35,35,,,
08689,Mikan,Trial 2,Huh? You should've said so sooner!,13,2,0,36,36,,,
08690,Mikan,Trial 2,I-is that true?,13,2,0,37,37,,,
08691,Mikan,Trial 2,"N-now that you m-mention it, you're right!",13,2,0,38,38,,,
08692,Mikan,Trial 2,"B-but wh-what if, for instance, she got help from someone?",13,2,0,39,39,,,
08693,Mikan,Trial 2,I see! You don't have to throw it away if you can just hide it somewhere on your body.,13,2,0,40,40,,,
08694,Mikan,Trial 2,N-nooo! Please don't be violent!,13,2,0,41,41,,,
08695,Mikan,Trial 2,U-umm... Is it true? Did you really kill Mahiru...?,13,2,0,42,42,,,
08696,Mikan,Trial 2,I-I don't get it! I dont get it at all!,13,2,0,43,43,,,
08697,Mikan,Trial 2,Ahhhhh!?,13,2,0,44,44,,,
08698,Mikan,Trial 2,A f-few s-sacrifices? Th-that's-!,13,2,0,45,45,,,
08699,Mikan,Trial 2,A d-distinct difference?,13,2,0,46,46,,,
08700,Mikan,Trial 2,T-tool? Wh-what do you mean?,13,2,0,47,47,,,
08701,Mikan,Trial 2,B-but... We already voted!,13,2,0,48,48,,,
08702,Mikan,Trial 3,"After I rested for a bit, I started counting everyone at the hospital.",13,3,0,1,1,,,
08703,Mikan,Trial 3,And then... I noticed Ibuki was gone s-so I sprinted out of the hospital!,13,3,0,2,2,,,
08704,Mikan,Trial 3,Coincidentally I ran into Fuyuhiko so I plead with him in various ways to see if he could help me out.,13,3,0,3,3,,,
08705,Mikan,Trial 3,"And s-so we decided to lower the hanged body, didn't we?",13,3,0,4,4,,,
08706,Mikan,Trial 3,If Hajime's testimony is a lie...,13,3,0,5,5,,,
08707,Mikan,Trial 3,...then the fact that Ibuki hung herself...,13,3,0,6,6,,,
08708,Mikan,Trial 3,A-ahhh! Th-they were?,13,3,0,7,7,,,
08709,Mikan,Trial 3,So they looked like they had just rushed over.,13,3,0,8,8,,,
08710,Mikan,Trial 3,"B-but, if you just stick them together with glue you'd be able to break down the door easily, y'know?",13,3,0,9,9,,,
08711,Mikan,Trial 3,"Aww, what unimaginable speed for a slowpoke like me...",13,3,0,10,10,,,
08712,Mikan,Trial 3,J-just revealed?,13,3,0,11,11,,,
08713,Mikan,Trial 3,Then... the reason the wallpaper was covered in so many stickers was to make it look like that pillar!,13,3,0,12,12,,,
08714,Mikan,Trial 3,"B-but, going to the trouble of hiding the body and the pillar is very bold and risky.",13,3,0,13,13,,,
08715,Mikan,Trial 3,"I knew it! There are so many similarities, it must have been intentional.",13,3,0,14,14,,,
08716,Mikan,Trial 3,Where there even any footprints at the crime scene?,13,3,0,15,15,,,
08717,Mikan,Trial 3,"Actually, the bleeding will stop once the heart stops beating so I don't think they had to go that far...",13,3,0,16,16,,,
08718,Mikan,Trial 3,"Th-that's right, I didn't know the time of death because of the heater!",13,3,0,17,17,,,
