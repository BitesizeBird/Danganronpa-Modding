Nonstop Debate (nonstop), Shot Through the Heart (kokoro) and Rebuttal Showdown (hanron) files follow this format.
Hanron also seem to have a section at the end that determines where the Showdown should loop from if the player has advanced???

Need to check the Header values too!!!
The first byte pair varies between 2C 01, 68 01, A4 01. (little endian?) (And there may be more byte pairs?)
The second byte pair looks to be the Text Count, much like the .lin script files.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x00 - TextID
---
TextID|x

The ID of the text. 
This is checked by the Check Flag A|0, x line in the relevant .lin script file.

e.g.
TextID|1

Identifies the 1st (starting from 0) text to display.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x01 - Type
---
Type|x

Determines the type the text will be.

0 - Normal 
1+ - White noise where this number is the number of shots it takes to clear the noise (maybe not exactly???) and the amount of seconds added to the timer when it's cleared.

For Rebuttal Showdowns, always 0 for opponent text and 2 for player text???
So this could determine which half of the screen to apply the effects???

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x02 - Slashes
---
0x2|x

This function is for Rebuttal Showdowns and so is always set to 0 for Nonstop Debates. 

For Rebuttal Showdowns, this value determines how many slashes it takes to clear the text.

e.g.
0x2|2

The player needs to slash this text 2 times before destroying it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x03 - Shoot With Evidence
---
Shoot With Evidence|x

Determines which Truth Bullet/Blade to use on the weak point.
If set to 255, it is a weak point with no correct truth bullet.
If set to 65535, there is no weak point.

e.g.
Shoot With Evidence|1

Shooting this text's weakpoint with Truth Bullet 1 (starting from 0) will register as correct.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x04 - Shoot with Argue Point
---
0x4|x

Determines which Argue Point to use on the weak point where x is the TextID of that weak point.
(In game, the player sometimes needs to 'memorize' a weak point using the 'Truth Flashback' and then shoot it at another weak point.)
(i.e. absorb a weak point and shoot it at another.)

If this value is set to anything but 65535, make sure to set the Shoot With Evidence value to 255 so that no other truth bullets will work.
Set to 65535 otherwise.

e.g.
Shoot With Evidence|255
0x4|3

There will be a weak point for this text that can only be successfully shot with the 'absorbed' weak point that came from the section with TextID|3.


For Rebuttal Showdowns, since this mechanic doesn't exist in this mode, it's often 65535 too.

However, for player text, this seems to point to the section that starts the second part of the argument.
(But if the player has multiple concurrent lines, the value for 0x4 is instead the value for the next text's TextID???)
(This wasn't the case for at least Hanron 3??? The first player text was still 65535 and then the second was the expected value, that being the value of the next section's TextID.)

So this might be to set where the argument should now loop from???
If so, 65535 could be to not overwrite this value.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x05 - Early Advance Frame
---
0x5|x

Used for Rebuttal Showdowns.

For Nonstop Debates, these are set to 2000 for normal remarks (though some in the Izuru debate have 200 but this seems like a mistake).
(Could be worth looking at the Izuru debate and the debate straight after it to see what functions and parameters the game uses!!!)

Otherwise, 0 is used for white noise.


For Rebuttal Showdowns, this is used to determine if the text can advance to the next section if the player slashes this text away.

0 - Can't advance early
1 - Can advance early

This is often set to 1 for the section that appears in a group of sections that appear sequentially.

e.g. (NOTE: This is NOT how the game formats its code and is a combination of some .lin code and nonstop .dat code.)
Section 0:
Text|"Did you"
Advance|30
0x5|0

Section 1:
Text|"forget what..."
Advance|30
0x5|0

Section 2:
Text|"Kazuichi said earlier?"
Advance|180
0x5|1

"Did you", "forget what...", "Kazuichi said earlier?" all appear one 30 frames after the other.
If the player slashes Section 0 or 1 away, nothing different will happen.
However, if the player slashes away Section 2, the game will advance to Section 3 regardless if it has been 180 frames (see the Advance function below).
This is usually set to 1 at the end of a group like this because the first sections appear too fast anyway.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x06 - Has Weak Point
---
Has Weak Point|x

Determines if the text has a weak point.

0 - No weak point.
1 - Has a weak point.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x07 - Advance After Frame
---
Advance|x

The amount of frames to wait before moving to the next text section. Usually this is based around 210.
As white noise is present, the timing of these must be taken into account too.

e.g.
Advance|210

210 frames after this text has applied, apply the next text section.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x08 - ???
---
0x8|x

???
Unsure what this is.
This usually is set to 2 when 0x1c (Vertical Characters) is set to 1.
However, this isn't always the case. Sometimes, 0x8 is set to 2 when 0x1c is set to 0, and 0x8 is sometimes set to 0 when 0x1c is set to 1.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x09 - Entry Effect
---
0x9|x

Determines the type of entry transition to apply to the text.
Often this value matches with Transition below but it doesn't have to.

0 - Fade in
1 - Starting large, then the text scales to determined size while fading in and rotating into place
3 - Enters the screen fast by accelerating towards determined angle

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x0a - Exit Effect
---
Transition|x

Determines the type of exit transition to apply to the text.

0 - Fade out
1 - The text rotates as it shrinks and fades out.
3 - Exits the screen fast by accelerating towards determined angle

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x0b - Fade Out
---
Fade out|x

Determines which frame to fade out the text after initially displaying it??
This seems to usually match Advance.

e.g.
Fade out|210

Fade the text out after 210 frames have passed (which is 3.5 seconds).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x0c - Horizontal
---
Horizontal|x

The starting horizontal position where the text is displayed.
Seems to use the PSP's resolution values of 480 × 272.
So 0 is the left edge of the screen, 240 is the center and 480 is the right edge.

e.g.
Horizontal|120

Display the text 120 across, so 1/4 across from the left side of the screen.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x0d - Vertical
---
Vertical|x

The starting vertical position where the text is displayed.
Seems to use the PSP's resolution values of 480 × 272.
So 0 is the top edge of the screen, 136 is the center and 272 is the bottom edge.

e.g.
Vertical|204

Display the text 204 down, so 3/4s down the screen.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x0e - Angle Acceleration
---
Angle Acceleration|x

Determines how fast the text travels towards the specified Angle (see 0x0f below)???

e.g.
Angle Acceleration|25

Make the text travel towards the specified angle at a speed of 25.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x0f - Angle
---
Angle|x

The angle at which the text will travel towards.
Goes from 0 to 359 (presumably??? Probably loops around) where 0 is travelling up the screen and goes clockwise.

e.g.
Angle|270

Makes the text travel across the screen towards the left.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x10 - Scale
---
Scale|x

The starting size of the text.
This value is usually around 80 - 200. 
Around 120 is a good, standard size.

e.g.
Scale|150

Shows the text starting from size 150.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x11 - Final Scale
---
Final Scale|x

The ending size of the text.
When set to 100, the scale of the text won't change with time. Presumably this is a percentage.


e.g.
Scale|80
Final Scale|120

Starts the text as size 80.
Then, while that text is displayed, it grows in size to 120%.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x12 - Text Shake
---
0x12|x

Seems to control whether to shake the Text or not.

0 - No text shake.
1 - The text shakes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x13 - Rotation
---
Rotation|x

The starting rotation of the text. Measured in degrees going clockwise from around the center of the text.

While this seems similar to Angle, this is to determine the angle of the text itself. Angle is used to determine where the text should travel towards.
Though usually, these two parameters are set similarly so that the text points towards where it is heading.

e.g.
Rotation|10

Shows the text starting from a rotation 10 degrees clockwise.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x14 - Rotation Speed
---
Rotation Speed|x

When set to a value above 0, the text will rotate.

x seems to be the number of degrees per second that the text rotates.

To rotate anti-clockwise, set x = 65535 - y
where y is the rotation speed.

(Unsure where the cutoff point is for when the game starts rotating anti-clockwise.)
(The highest value used for clockwise rotation is 360 so perhaps this is the limit???)

e.g.
Rotation Speed|100

Rotate the text at 100 degrees per second.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x15 - Character
---
Character|x

Determines which character is speaking?
This is set to 0 for white noise.

Determines sprite, voice line, and where the camera is pointing towards??? Probably not considering the white noise.

Character|1

Make Nagito the speaker of the text.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x16 - Sprite
---
Sprite|x

Determines which expression to use for the determined character.
This is set to 0 for white noise.

Sprite|1

Use expression 1 (starting from 0) for the determined character.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x17 - Background Animation
---
Background Animation|x

Presumably this is the Trial Camera to use.
Check against the Trial Camera values to see if they match!!!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x18 - Portrait Shake
---
0x18|x

Controls whether to shake the character portrait or not.

0 - No shake.
1 - Shake.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x19 - Voice
---
Voice|x

Used to determine which voice line to use from the Character specified above and the Chapter specified below.

If set to 65535, no voice clip will play.

e.g.
Voice|2

Use Voice Line 2 from the Character and Chapter specified.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x1a - Time Bonus
---
0x1a|x

Used for Nonstop Debates.
For Rebuttal Showdowns, this value is always set to 0.

This determines the amount of time the player will gain/lose if they shoot that text with the silencer.

Shooting remarks with the silencer will decrease the timer by x amount of seconds.
If the player is on Mean Action difficulty, x will automatically be multipled by 1.5 (rounded down).

For remarks in the base game, this is set to 10, 15 or 20, increasing in scale as the player progresses through the game.
(Chapters 1 to 3: x = 10)
(Chapters 4 & 5: x = 15)
(Chapter 6: x = 20)


Clearing white noise text with the silencer will increase the timer by x amount of seconds.

For white noise in the base game, this value is usually between 1 and 4 and matches the value of Type.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x1b - Chapter
---
Chapter|x

Used to determine which voice line to use as voice lines are categorised by chapter. (???)

e.g.
Chapter|1

Use the voice line specified that is from Chapter 1.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x1c - Vertical Characters
---
0x1c|x

This function does not have any effect in the English version.
Used only for Japanese text.
(Might apply to other non-romanic-language versions but not romanic-language versions.)

This seems to be used when the text is read from top to bottom rather than left to right.
So each character is individually rotated 90 degrees anti-clockwise.

0 - Horizontal characters
1 - Vertical characters

(Check to see if other values such as 1 have any effect!!! Perhaps even backwards text but more likely just rotating characters the other way if anything.)

(0x1c is set to 1 sometimes in the first 'Chapter 14' Nonstop Debate which is presumably the first DR1 debate.
However, the text isn't vertical there in DR1 itself.
This could mean that 0x1c is a new function for DR2 used in place of 0x8 but if so, completely unsure why.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x1d - ???
---
0x1d|x

Always seems to match Character value.
Could be to determine either the character voice line to use or which character portrait to display??? Position of sprite??? Where the camera is pointing towards???

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x1e - ???
---
0x1e|x

???
Always seems to be set to 65535 for main chapter Nonstop Debates and Rebuttal Showdowns???
But this is set to 0 for all 'Chapter 14' debates. Chapter 14 nonstop files look to be copies of the DR1 Chapter 1 Nonstop Debates.
(May need to look at DR1 nonstop files to see if this is used with different parameters and then went unused for DR2!!!)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x1f - Slashed Text Mood Effect
---
0x1f|x

This function is for Rebuttal Showdowns and so is always set to 0 for Nonstop Debates. 

If the player successfully clears the text by slashing it, the 'Mood' will shift, meaning that the middle of the screen will shift horizontally.
Shifting to the right is in favour of the opponent.
Shifting to the left is in favour of the player.

To shift right, simply put the parameter to the value you desire.

e.g.
0x20|5
This shifts the screen right by 5.


To shift left, put the parameter as 65536 - y
where y is your desired amount.

e.g. 
0x20|65530
This shifts the screen to the left by 6.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x20 - Missed Text Mood Effect
---
0x20|x

This function is for Rebuttal Showdowns and so is always set to 0 for Nonstop Debates. 

If the player fails to clear the text, the 'Mood' will shift, meaning that the middle of the screen will shift horizontally.
Shifting to the right is in favour of the opponent.
Shifting to the left is in favour of the player.

To shift right, simply put the parameter to the value you desire.

e.g.
0x20|5
This shifts the screen right by 5.


To shift left, put the parameter as 65536 - y
where y is your desired amount.

e.g. 
0x20|65530
This shifts the screen to the left by 6.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

0x21 - ???
---
0x21|x

???
Always set to 0 for Nonstop Debates???
Always set to 65535 for Rebuttal Showdowns???
Could be a flag to indicate the end of a section??? Though why nonstop and hanron use different values wouldn't make sense???

(May need to look at DR1 nonstop files to see if this is was an existing function or created for DR2!!!)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
