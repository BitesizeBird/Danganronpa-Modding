Change UI

Change UI|Element, State

Element - ???
State - In most cases, setting a UI element's state to 0 will hide/disable it, while 1 will show/enable it.

e.g. Change UI|1, 0

Text box format ???
---
Format|Type

Type - The type of text box formatting. ???
0 - Other character speaking ???
4 - Player character speaking/thoughts ???

e.g. Format|0

This is for the UI, NOT for the text colour. (MAYBE IT IS?)


Text for a character speaking/thinking
---
Text|Dialogue\n

\n for new line
Roughly 55 characters can fit per line so use \n after that.
Always end dialogue with \n

Surround text with certain <CLT> numbers for different colours/sizes.
<CLT 04>Text<CLT>\n for thoughts
<CLT 17>Text<CLT> for weakpoints
See CLTs.png for all of them. They go up to 96 though many are unused.

e.g. Text|To be honest, I'm also... No, everyone else feels the\nsame, too.\n
e.g. Text|<CLT 04>I have to remember how I got here...<CLT>\n


Speaker ???
---
Speaker|39

e.g. Speaker

Speaker|0 for Hajime ???


Sprite
---
Sprite|Position (in trials and something else outside ???), Character, Expression, Fade-in type ???, slide-in type ??? or Position outside of trials ???

Position - Outside of trials, determines if a new character is speaking, During trials, determines which podium the sprite should go in. Further explanation below.
Character - Self explanatory. Use the above Character IDs to specify which character.
Expression - Which sprite of that character to use. 
Fade-in type - How a sprite fades into view. 0 is no fade in, 1 is fast fade-in, 2 is slow fade-in
Slide-in type - How a sprite slides into view. 0 is no slide in, 1 and 2 for the rest. ??? Good for dialogue between multiple characters outside of trials.

e.g. Sprite|0, 0, 16, 1, 2

This shows Hajime's sprite with expression 16 with a fast fade in and sliding in from the left. ???

In the base game, the last two parameters are always set to 0.

IMPORTANT - defining which character's sprite also determines who is shown speaking in the textbox too.


Position
--- 	
Outside of trials, use 0 for the first NPC to speak. ???
Alternate between using 0 and 1 every time a new NPC speaks. ???
If the same character has a second text box after the first, keep using the same number???

e.g. (I've simplified just to Sprite and Text below where there would usually be more.)
Sprite|1, 6, 5, 1, 2
Text|ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE WITH A FIGHTING SPIRIT!!!\n

Sprite|0, 3, 1, 1, 0
Text|A bold boast... However, let me give you some advice.\n

Sprite|0, 3, 18, 1, 0
Text|The truly strong...do not raise their voice so\nrecklessly.\n

Sprite|1, 11, 1, 1, 1
Text|Hey, hey! Let's start talking already!\n

Here, Nekomaru speaks (with position 1), then Gunhdam speaks twice (position is set to 0 both times), then Hiyoko speaks (with position 1).


For trials, the number will match the character ID and put them in that character's podium.
			i.e. Sonia's ID is 10. Setting the Position to 10 will put that sprite into Sonia's trial position.
			For maps, there are already pre-defined positions so just use those.
			For regular dialogue, use 0 for the character (aside the player's) who talks first.
			1 for everyone else to denote that they're in a different position ???
			Seemingly, the script alternates between using 0 and 1 each time a new character talks
			
e.g. Sprite|10, 12, 16, 1, 2 = Mahiru expression 16 in Sonia's trial position
The Character ID also shows which character is speaking (during trials)

Check difficulty??? - 0x3b|1, x (245 for Mean, 247 for Fair, 249 for Gentle)
0x3b|1, 245

Truth bullets - 0x32|x - Truth bullets loaded. Must include 0x32|255 at the end? (Perhaps to validate 'incorrect' weak points that don't have truth bullets)
0x32|1
